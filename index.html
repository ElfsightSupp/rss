<description>Did you know that we have robust review management software available, and it's FREE! Check out our reputation management tips for disputing a bad Google review and how to fix it.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-9821386.jpeg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you're the owner or manager of a business, it's important to keep an eye on your Google reviews. After all, potential customers will often base their decision on whether or not to use your business based on what others have said. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you do find a negative review, there's no need to panic. In most cases, you can reach out to the customer and resolve the issue. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If you’re tasked with reputation management, you should know how to deal with negative Google reviews. A client may come to you asking, “How can you help me remove a negative Google review?” Now you're wondering how to dispute a Google review. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Sadly, you can’t just open a Google Business Profile, click a few tabs, and see that glimmering Delete button. It’s not possible. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> But there are other ways to dispute and remove a Google review. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to dispute a Google review </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Google has standard policies for Google reviews. If you can prove someone has posted a fake or inappropriate review according to their policies, you have a chance to get the review removed. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> One of the first steps for how to dispute a Google review is to involve the Google team. You need to ask them to review the suspicious review and remove it. But there is no guarantee that they will do so. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> You may also have to wait weeks to get a response. It’s even possible that you may not get a response at all. However, to save a client’s reputation, it’s worth a try. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> Types of Google reviews that are eligible for a dispute </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> According to Google’s review policy, you can dispute some specific types of reviews that are mentioned below. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <ul> <li style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Spammy or fake reviews – Google will likely remove spammy or manipulative content that may repeatedly appear on several reviews. </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Reviews that are irrelevant – You can flag off-topic reviews that contain any irrelevant social, personal, or political commentary. However, reviews that contain someone’s genuine experience with a business will be considered valid. </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Illegal or sexually explicit content – You may request to delete Google reviews that contain something illegal, locally restricted, or sexually explicit. Offensive and dangerous content that harasses your client or contains hate speech also falls under this criteria. </span> </li> </ul> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If the review in question fits one of these criteria, you can flag that review in the hope that Google will remove it. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to flag Google reviews </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you think competitors have attempted to wrong your business, you should flag such fake reviews. It’s easy. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> The Google team members will review your flagged Google review. They will remove it if only they find it violates their policy. You might get a response after several days. It’ll be best to ask the client to flag the review as well. In that way, it will help you draw more attention. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Here are the steps to follow when flagging a Google review: </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <ol> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Log in to the Google Business Profile Manager of your client’s business </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Select the correct location if there are multiple </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Find “Reviews” in the menu </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Find the review you want to flag and click the three-dot menu </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Then choose “Flag as inappropriate” </span> </li> </ol> <p style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you fail to draw the attention of Google, there are other ways to delete a Google review in question. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <ol> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Tweet to Google </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Contact Google Business Profile Support </span> </li> <li style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Request dissatisfied customers to delete or change their reviews directly </span> </li> </ol> <p style="line-height: inherit;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to contact Google Business Profile Support </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Informing Google Business Profile (GBP) Support about an unfair review is another tactic to dispute a Google review and get it removed. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Before doing that, make sure you have the evidence to support your claim. The more organized and informative your email, the better. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Capture a few screenshots of the review in question. Along with the screenshots, add your contact information to submit the email to GBP Support. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you are lucky, you’ll get a reply within 48 hours. However, if you don't get a response from them, don't lose hope. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> There is another way to reach them. You can Tweet them. It’ll take minutes. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to tweet to Google </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you're still trying to determine how to dispute a Google review, you can try to post a tweet. You have to post this tweet from the official Twitter account of the business for which you want to remove the review. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Tweet to (@GoogleMyBiz) and let the GBP team know about your issue. Explain the situation clearly in your tweet. Tell them how the suspicious review is violating their policy. Also, attach the screenshots. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> After tweeting, you might get a reply from the GBP team. Then you can follow their instructions to move forward with this issue. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> You can also try filing a legal removal request to dispute a Google review. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to file a legal removal request </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Another step you can take for how to dispute a Google review: If you can prove a customer or competitor is trying to sabotage your client’s reputation, you can reach Google directly. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Just fill out a form and submit your complaint to  </span> <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en" target="_blank" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Google’s </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> </span> </span> <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en" target="_blank" style="display: initial; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> Legal </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> </span> </span> <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en" target="_blank" style="display: initial; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> Help Center </a> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> . Go there and click Create a Request. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> All these strategies we have described are to remove fake, biased, or manipulative Google reviews. But what if you got a legitimate review, and it’s a bad one? </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Bad reviews can be frustrating for small or new businesses. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> What should you do if your client asks you to remove a bad review from their Google Business Profile? We have solutions for that too. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> Is it possible to delete a negative Google review? </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> It would be much easier for you if you could simply delete a bad review. Sadly, no simple strategies can help you here. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Only a reviewer can delete or modify a Google review. However, this gives you an opportunity to resolve the issue directly and improve customer satisfaction for your client. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; display: initial;"> How to ask customers to delete or change a review </span> </p> <p style="letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 1.2em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Never force a client’s customers to amend their reviews.  </span> <a href="/local-business-app" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Respond to the negative reviews </a> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;">  and collect their contact information. Try to reach them by phone to discuss the problem. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you talk to them and resolve their issue over the phone, most likely, it will bring positive results. Clarify the situation. Tell them why this may have happened and how apologetic your client is. Never make excuses or get defensive. Instead, own the mistakes (even if you have made none). </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> If you are able to calm the customer, politely ask them to take down the review or update it. Also, never forget to thank the customer for sharing their honest feedback. Show them your client values their opinion. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> You won’t manage to win hearts every time. But you should always try. If your attempts to remove a negative review fail, you can try promoting the good ones. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> You can always bury a few bad reviews by  </span> <a href="/local-business-app" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> getting more positive reviews </a> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;">  from your client’s customers. If you achieve a lot of new positive Google reviews, online searchers may not ever find the old negative comments. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; display: initial;"> Always ask satisfied customers to leave a Google review. Don't forget to help them find your client’s Google business page. This will encourage clients to leave feedback even more. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> How Reputation Management Software can help get more reviews </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Keeping track of reviews, responding to them, and disputing them can be overwhelming. Your challenge might be more widespread than simply determining how to dispute a Google review. Many business owners invest in reputation management software. </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <a href="https://yourdigitalagency.smblogin.com/public/store/8G42/default/app/RM" style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank"> Did you know that we have a robust review management software available, and its FREE!

<title>HOW THE RECENT META BAN WAVE HAS IMPACTED YOUR AD CAMPAIGNS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-the-recent-meta-ban-wave-has-impacted-your-ad-campaigns</link>
<description>Our specialists have informed us through industry research that a ban wave is also experienced by large and small advertisers across the Meta platform. These ban waves tend to happen when Meta has made some backend changes in how their automated system is flagging assets.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-3777568.jpeg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="line-height: 32px;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What is this? </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Since the start of August, we have been seeing a large number of Facebook pages being hit with restrictions preventing them from advertising. Thankfully, this does not affect any of the page’s organic posting or capabilities; however, it hinders our ability to fulfill the digital advertising fulfillment services effectively. We have not seen page restrictions like this for years on pages on which we runs ad. As such, it is bizarre for us to see nearly a dozen pages get restricted in the last month.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 32px;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What’s changing? </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Our specialists have informed us through their industry research that a ban wave is also being experienced by large and small advertisers across the Meta platform. These ban waves tend to happen when Meta has made some backend change in how their automated system is flagging assets. Typically these assessments are overly aggressive at first and are adjusted over time on Meta’s end to catch bad actors only and more precisely. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Based on our team’s findings, we are not seeing the ads on the accounts getting flagged prior to the page’s restrictions, nor are we seeing  </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies_center/ads" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> any clear ad policy violations </a> <span style="display: initial;">  in the ads whose pages are being restricted. It is important to note that Meta will never tell us why a page has been restricted or whether it was in fact an ad that caused the restriction. This is to prevent bad actors from finding ways around their automated systems; however, they will provide  </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/975570072950669?id=434838534925385" target="_blank" style="display: initial; text-decoration: none;"> a list of all the possible reasons a page might be restricted </a> <span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none;"> . </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 32px;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> How does it impact you? </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> In the instances we have seen so far, our team has filed appeals and continue to follow up with Meta support until we get a resolution. Unfortunately, we have not yet seen any restricted pages be reactivated by Meta. This may be due to the fact that during these ban waves, the internal Meta review team is hit by in turn a huge wave of review requests. This slows down turn around time and, in our experience, the quality of the review advertisers receive. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> It is also important to note that Meta places a strict wall between the support people advertisers can talk to and the team who does the reviews. This reduces our ability to affect the investigation as we can never speak to the internal review team directly. This also means that it is impossible to determine if a human has ever actually done your review or if it has again been handled by their automated system (as many current and former Meta employees claim). </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> We plan to continue advocating on behalf of all of our Partners, even when the first appeal is rejected. It is important to recognize that it is more likely that, regardless of the legitimacy of the restriction, Meta may not re-review or lift the restriction. It is possible that Meta support may be more helpful when the ban wave dies down, but this is not guaranteed. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> For those affected by the ban wave, we are recommending either shifting your advertising budget to different platforms in the meantime or creating a new FB page purely for running advertisements. We also suggest limiting changes to ads until the ban wave dies down. This is to avoid causing any further triggers to the automated system reviewing ads that are currently live. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.6;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> We apologize for the inconvenience and understand the frustration around Meta’s lack of transparency. If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to discuss this change further, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our Support team </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>5 REASONS TO USE AN ONLINE SCHEDULING TOOL</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/5-reasons-to-use-an-online-scheduling-tool</link>
<description/>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-1314544.jpeg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you own or manage a business, chances are you've considered using an online scheduling tool. Here are 5 reasons why you should:  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Whether you’re scheduling client bookings for a salon or scheduling a meeting with a colleague in a different time zone, manual appointment scheduling is time-consuming. It’s also a process that’s prone to human error. Double-bookings can be common, which can lead to a negative online review and impact search engine optimization (SEO) performance. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In this guide, we explore five reasons to use an automated booking software, allowing you to reduce the risk of scheduling errors while improving customer experience, employee productivity, and cash flow. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 1. Generate bookings and leads 24/7 </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Did you know 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday is the most popular time to book an appointment?With most staff typically working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., responding to a backlog of appointment requests submitted over the weekend can take time and frustrate customers.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A survey by GetApp found 94 percent of customers are more likely to choose a new service provider if that provider offered an online booking option. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Automated scheduling software provides the benefit of allowing customers to: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Book at a time convenient for them </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Select a particular person they want to receive the service from, and view their real-time availability </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Reschedule without needing to call </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> These features can help prevent you from being bombarded with back and forth messages or phone calls about booking an appointment. Plus, it can help prevent the loss of prospects who were keen to book outside work hours but lost interest because that business didn’t have online scheduling functionality. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 2. Impress new clients </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Informing new clients and prospects about what to expect ahead of their first appointment can create a good impression and help boost productivity. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You may send the standard “thank you for booking” confirmation email, but when additional information about a customer is required, smart scheduling software allows you to: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Add questions to meeting requests </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Collect key attendee details </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Process payments </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> This can help save you the headache and staffing time required for menial tasks like confirmation calls and chasing up invoices. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 3. Deal with fewer phone calls </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Given the popularity of platforms like Airbnb, Uber, and OpenTable, customers are increasingly expecting frictionless and digitized booking experiences for services they wish to access. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Consider the following data points from various surveys: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> 59 percent of the general population are frustrated with waiting times and the inconvenient office hours related to scheduling appointments by phone (GetApp, 2021) </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> 75 percent of Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) avoid phone calls because they are “too time-consuming” (BankMyCell, 2020) </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> 81 percent of Millennials feel anxious before making a call (BankMyCell, 2020) </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> These statistics are a clear indication that local businesses should be evolving their tech stack and aligning their customer journey to evolving preferences. Even better, less time spent on the phone dealing with appointment queries is better for businesses as owners and employees can spend time undertaking more valuable tasks. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 4. Save costs and reduce “no-show” risk </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Software consulting giant Accenture’s research found that the United States healthcare system would have saved $3.2 billion in 2019 alone if more people booked appointments online. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It takes under a minute to schedule medical appointments online, compared to 8.1 minutes on the phone, with staff transferring calls 63 percent of the time, resulting in more booking-related paperwork and less time on patient care. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> “Just as consumers use online tools to book restaurant reservations or request a cab, patients want the same experience in self-booking a doctor’s appointment,” Accenture’s report noted.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Furthermore, appointment reminder functionality typically built into scheduling software more than halves the risk of a no-show, according to a separate analysis of customer behavior by 10to8.com. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 5. Increased employee productivity </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In a Udemy 2018 report, 60 percent of employees said that poorly scheduled and unorganized meetings distract them from working efficiently and productively.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> That’s why meetings and how they are scheduled should not be taken for granted, especially for rapidly-growing SMBs with hybrid work environments and employees who reside across different states and countries.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Automated meeting scheduling can eliminate behaviours such as:  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Employees asking each other “when are you free?” to initiate a meeting </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> The need to check calendars throughout the day </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Attaching video conferencing links to meeting events manually </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Manually working out time zone differences to hold meetings with colleagues across different jurisdictions </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A suitable scheduling tool should handle most meeting-related logistics, including adding video conferencing links, finding a time to meet, and meeting preparation tasks.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Did you know we offer uor cluents access to a </span> </span> <a href="/contact" style="display: initial;"> Free Online Scheduling Tool?  Ask Us How? </a> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>THE METAVERSE: A FUTURE OF VIRTUAL & AUGMENTED REALITY</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/the-metaverse-a-future-of-virtual-augmented-reality</link>
<description>Virtual Reality has become one of the most exciting emerging technologies over the last few years. VR will hugely impact our daily lives, and there’s no telling what new developments we might see in the coming decade or so. The practical applications are virtually limitless when it comes to this emerging technology — from education to gaming to training/simulation and everything in between — there is no end to what VR can do.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/METAVERSE.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Virtual reality (VR), also known as immersive virtual reality, is the creation of a virtual environment to make it seem as real as possible. Virtual realities can be either simulated or augmented. In a simulation, authors create digital worlds for users to explore, often called virtual worlds. AR allows for an interactive digital rendering of the real world using cameras and software. For instance, in augmented reality, digital images and video are overlaid on top of what the user can see with their natural vision.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Virtual Reality has become one of the most exciting emerging technologies over the last few years. VR will have a huge impact on our daily lives and there’s no telling what new developments we might see in the coming decade or so. The practical applications are virtually limitless when it comes to this emerging technology — from education to gaming to training/simulation and everything in between — there really is no end to what VR can do. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> What is Virtual Reality? </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Virtual reality is a definition rather than a specific type of experience. If you want to think of it as a specific type of experience, it’s the act of immersing your whole body in a computer-generated 3D environment. It can be entirely digital or it can be mixed with elements of reality. To put it simply, virtual reality is an alternate reality that you can interact with and control. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The definition of virtual reality could change significantly over the next few years as we begin to explore more and more different methods for achieving this goal. For example, while VR typically involves some type of head-mounted stereo display and gloves, emerging technologies like augmented reality will likely have their own definitions and experiences.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In order to understand what VR entails, you should also check out the augmented reality. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> AR in Virtual Reality </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Augmented reality (AR) is the process of enhancing a real-world environment using virtual elements to create a combined view where both the physical and digital components blend together. Much like VR, AR can be either simulated or augmented. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Augmented reality is going to play an enormous role in our lives over the next few years as it becomes more affordable and easier to use. Whether users are looking for a way to help them study for their college exams or want a fun game that utilizes their newest phone, AR is the solution they've been waiting for. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The impact of AR on business will be obvious in the near future by allowing software developers to create more engaging and immersive experiences for their customers. And with all these new tools at our disposal, we're bound to see some major developments in areas such as marketing, education, and even medicine. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> How to make VR and AR work together </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are becoming more widely accepted and used. Both of these technologies have their distinct advantages and disadvantages, but they are both going to play a significant role in our future. There’s no telling what kind of advancements we will see with the combination of VR and AR development in the coming years. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Both Virtual Reality and AR have their own strengths and weaknesses, but if you want to make them work together, it’s important that you decide what you want to do with your immersive experience. If you just want to explore a virtual world for fun, then AR is for you. If you want to enhance an existing environment or space with digital information, then VR is for you. However, if your goal is to create a new immersive experience from scratch, then it might be better suited as a Mixed Reality project that combines both of these headsets into one device. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> The Metaverse: A future of virtual reality, augmented reality &amp; more </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With the advent of virtual reality and augmented reality, one can expect many new innovations. Given that there’s no telling what will happen in the future with VR and AR, it would be safe to say that a Metaverse is a place where many people will live their lives in the future. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The term "metaverse" was coined by Neal Stephenson in his novel Snow Crash. This futuristic world is made up of virtual worlds, which are places created on computers or other devices that users can access through software. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> Metaverse concepts </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The Metaverse is a term to describe the idea of an interconnected digital network. It’s not just about technological advancements, but also how we interact and communicate with one another through technology. In the Metaverse, users can create avatars that represent themselves in virtual worlds and communicate with other people using voice or text-based communication. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With VR becoming more popular and AR on the rise, there has been increased interest in various applications of this emerging technology. In addition to new gaming applications like video games, many are looking at ways they can use these technologies in education to help develop their students’ critical thinking skills. With VR being able to immerse learners into an environment, it can be a powerful tool for teaching geography, history and even math — where students will be able to experience living in different countries or climates by simply putting on a headset. </span> </p> <h2> <span style="display: initial;"> Bottom line: Virtual Reality </span> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A future of virtual reality, augmented reality, and more. The possibilities that this technology has are endless. It’s not too much to think that in the future, your everyday life will be a lot different because of these emerging technologies. The best thing about VR is that with the right resources, it’s possible to create the future you want for yourself and everyone else around you. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>STEPS TO PICKING THE RIGHT DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY FOR YOUR BRAND</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/steps-to-picking-the-right-digital-marketing-agency-for-your-brand</link>
<description>Ask the Right Questions. Do your research. Take some time to assess the digital marketing agencies out there and find one that fits your budget and your needs, focusing on performance. Ask yourself what you want from a digital agency partner: are you looking for someone who can produce specific results for your brand? Or, do you want someone that can help establish a foundation of brand-specific marketing activities?</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/person-woman-eyes-face.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Do you have a new, upstart brand? Do you have a well-known, legacy company that needs an integrated digital strategy? If so, it’s likely time to think about going the agency route.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Digital marketing agencies operate as extensions of their clients—they are hired to offer a holistic approach to strategic marketing services, which means they are experts in everything from keyword research and conversion optimisation to customer experience management and search engine optimization (SEO). </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Finding the right agency can be daunting for brands at any level. With that in mind, here are five steps you should take before even approaching a digital marketing agency. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Know What You Want From a Digital Marketing Agency </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Before you start the hunt, make sure you know what kind of digital marketing agency you need.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> - Do you need a company that understands the nuances of your industry or sector?  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> - Do you want a one-stop shop that'll handle all your online marketing needs? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> - Are you looking for someone who will work on a long-term, strategic approach to digital marketing? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Once you've answered these questions, it's time to take a look at some agencies in your niche. To get started, find a few agencies who are doing similar work and contact them to set up an introductory meeting. After the introductory meeting, wait for feedback before making your decision. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Define Your Brand’s digital marketing goals </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The first thing you need to do is identify what your brand’s digital marketing goals are. What do you want your company to accomplish? What will you be communicating and how? These are the things that need to be established before you even think about looking for a digital marketing agency, because it's going to be important in terms of what the agency is willing and able to provide.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A good way of identifying these goals is by collecting information on competitors. Doing this will help you understand what they're doing, and it'll also show you where they're falling short. This type of research not only impacts how an agency can help you grow, but it also helps ensure that your needs are met. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Ask the Right Questions </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Do your research. Take some time to assess the digital marketing agencies out there and find one that fits both your budget and your needs, with a focus on performance. Ask yourself what it is you want from an digital agency partner: are you looking for someone who can produce specific results for your brand? Or, do you want someone that can help establish a foundation of brand-specific marketing activities?  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As part of this process, think about how far along in the planning process you are. If you are just getting started with your marketing strategy, consider partnering with a digital agency at an earlier stage of the process. If you need help executing campaigns or have been doing it on your own, then bring on an agency later in the game. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Take Stock of Staff and Expertise </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> First, look at the size of your staff and the size of their expertise. Starting with a small team can be beneficial as it’s easier to ensure that you have time to dedicate to the agency and its work. However, if you need more hands-on help with your project, maybe it’s time to outsource some parts of the process. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Second, take stock of where your company is today in terms of digital marketing strategy. Have you outsourced any parts of your strategy prior? What are your goals for this new agency? Do you want it to create a cohesive digital strategy, or do you want them to execute on a plan already in place? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Third, assess agency culture and how they handle their clients. Does their approach match what you are looking for? Are they open about communication or do they hold back information from clients or prospective clients? How long have they been in business? Are there any references from current clients who could speak on their behalf? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Fourth, consider the price point and how much control or access you want over the account. Some agencies offer full control over accounts while others will take a percentage commission structure based on deliverables met. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Fifth, familiarize yourself with their portfolio so that you understand what level of work--and what level of quality--they typically produce for each client type. This will be important as it will help guide your decision around which agency is right for your brand. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Negotiate Accordingly </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Before you hire a digital marketing agency, you have to know what their rates are, what their services entail, and the time frames involved. You’ll need to negotiate. You may not be able to find agencies with what you want on your first pass, or they may not have the resources available, so start negotiating before hiring them. Negotiating is important because it helps establish clear communication and expectations from the get-go. If a company says they can do something for $1 million per year, but then ask for $2 million in turn, chances are that this is not a relationship that will work for long-term success. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Don’t Rush the Decision </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It’s important to take your time when choosing a digital marketing agency. You want to make sure you find the right partner that has the expertise and experience you need, whether it be in SEO, PPC or conversion optimisation. If your brand is small and just starting out, it might make sense to start with a smaller firm that can provide consulting services on an ongoing basis as you grow. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If on the other hand your brand is more established and requires more hands-on support from a dedicated agency, then it might make sense to aim for an agency that already has pre-existing relationships with industry players such as Google and Facebook. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> This will ensure they have insight into how these platforms work and can build strategies accordingly. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Establish a What-If Discussion </span> </h4> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> </span> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The first step in choosing the right digital marketing agency is to have an idea of what you want them to do for you.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Think about some of your aspirations for your business. What do you hope to achieve with a digital marketing agency? Will they create SEO strategies, or will they just help manage the SEO efforts of your website? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Asking yourself these types of questions can help you determine whether a given agency can help you meet your needs. If not, keep looking.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Additionally, establish what kind of budget you are willing to spend and give that information to the agencies in question. Ask them how much it will cost for them to implement the strategies you are considering for your brand—and be specific about how long it will take before those strategies get executed. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-1013328.jpeg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Web design is an essential part of any business’s marketing strategy. Yet, designing a website can be challenging. Designing effective layouts, testing layouts on different types of devices, and creating high-quality graphics are just a few of the factors that come into play when you’re thinking about hiring a web design company in Sydney.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You need someone who can give your brand a consistent look so that every page looks uniform and modern. You also need someone who understands the latest trends in web design and how they affect your website as a business. And you need to do all of this at an affordable price. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then we’ve got some good news: There are plenty of affordable web design companies in Sydney that meet all those criteria! Here’s everything you should know before hiring one. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Here are a few things to consider before hiring: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> 1) How important is it to have a specific style? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> 2) How much do you want to spend on your website? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> 3) Is your current web designer not doing what you want? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> What To Look For In A Web Design Company In Sydney </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> To find the right web design company in Sydney, it’s important to remember that price is just one of many factors involved.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> \- Determine your budget before you start looking for a web design company in Sydney </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> \- You need to find a company that has a well-rounded team with diverse skillsets </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> \- Take time to do research on the project and make sure you like what you see </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> \- Look for companies that have a long history of customer service and satisfied clients  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> \- Understand what your needs are and make sure the design company you hire can meet them </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> How Much Does A Web Design Cost? </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Websites range in price depending on the company, the website’s specialty, and the amount of time it takes to design your website. You can get a basic web design for around $2000, a more complicated website with customisations for around $3000, and a premium website that is designed with exceptional graphics and features for about $6000. Some general costs to include in your budget are: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Domain registration  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Website hosting  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Design work (not including development of your site)  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Web designer's fees  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Printing/stationery costs </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> -Other miscellaneous expenses, like business cards and business stationery. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Check if the company has experience in similar projects </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> First of all, do your homework. By looking at their portfolio, you should check to see if the company has experience in a similar project. You will want someone who has experience in web design because you don’t want to hire a web design company that is new to the field. If you’re not sure how to find out whether or not a company has experience in designing websites for businesses, try Googling “company website design” and see if you can find any examples. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Ask about the design requirements for your website </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When you start thinking about hiring a web design company, it’s important to ask them what requirements they have for your website. You should get an idea of the main things that need to be done so that you can determine whether or not this is the right company for your needs. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> For example, some web design companies will require that you already have a website in place and that you provide them with some sample images of what you want changed on your website. Other companies might want to present mockups or prototypes before they begin working on your site. This is just one aspect of what you need to talk to potential web design companies about before you make any commitments. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Look at the portfolio of previous works </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Your first step when looking for a web design company in Sydney should be checking out their portfolio. You want to make sure that the company you hire has years of experience, an impressive list of clients, and plenty of examples of their work. The more detail you can see in the company’s website and work, the better your chances are for finding someone who is experienced and reliable. The site will also give you insight into what services they offer, how many clients they have worked with, and what kind of budget they typically provide. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Ask About Services Provided By The Company </span> </h4> <h4> <br/> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Before you decide on your web design company, ask about the services they provide. It’s important to check to see if they offer a variety of packages with different features. What is included in each package? How much do they cost? Are there certain features that are only available in certain packages and at a higher cost?  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you need to have a fully responsive website, for example, then be sure that your chosen company offers this service. And if you’re looking for someone who can create interactive e-commerce websites, make sure to ask about their capabilities as well. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> Final Words </span> </h4> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> </span> </h4> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Web design is an essential element of any business’s marketing strategy. It’s also one of the hardest things to hire for, especially when you need to find a web design company in Sydney. But luckily, there are plenty of affordable companies who can handle the task and give your brand a consistent look.  </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>WHITE LABEL MARKETING SERVICES</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/white-label-marketing-services</link>
<description>Not all agencies are created equal. It’s essential to research and find one with a track record of success in your industry and with your target audience. Another option is to use white-label marketing services. These agencies or companies offer their services under another company’s brand name.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/dmip/dms3rep/multi/hipster-white-tshirt.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Struggling to hire marketing talent? Consider white-label marketing services </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> it’s become even harder to hire great people for your business.  Even before the pandemic, it was hard to find team members. It was even more difficult to keep those people when you did find them. With people quitting over everything from wages to stress, it’s not any easier to keep employees today. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As an agency owner, the Great Resignation might have you worried. How will it affect your business? How will you be able to fulfill work for your clients if you can’t find the talent you need for your team? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The good news is there is a solution—white-label marketing services could be the answer you’re looking for. </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> What are white-label marketing services? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> White-label marketing services let you team up with the experts for marketing fulfillment. This team of experienced marketers works for you to ensure you deliver on promises. Better yet, everything that passes between the marketing team and the client has your brand on it. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> How does this work? It’s simple. You team up with the white-label marketing service provider. You tell them what your clients need. Then you work with the provider to develop scripts for interacting with your clients. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The marketing services provider then fulfills deliverables and services your clients have bought. The team will make sure every deliverable has your company’s logo and name. They’ll also work hard to understand the customer so they can deliver the top-notch marketing services your customers expect. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> What services can you offer with white-label marketing? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The services a white-label marketing provider offers will vary. Examples of white label digital marketing services include copywriting, listings management, and social media. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Some providers also offer detailed reporting, as well as a branded, customizable client portal. The marketing team may or may not interact directly with your clients—that’s up to you. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Other services might include: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Web design and maintenance </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Graphic design services </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Video production and editing </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> PPC ad campaign management </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Local SEO services </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Online reputation monitoring and management </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The list of possible services is exhaustive. No matter what you need, you can find a white-label marketing partner who offers it. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Knowing what your clients want before they do </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Choosing a white-label marketing services partner who offers more can help you grow in other ways too. There’s no need to wait for your clients to realize they need to be on video. Instead, you can proactively add video services as an option in social media services bundles. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You could also create a new bundle of services for clients who are looking for a new website. Why not get a new website with SEO and blog content? The three go hand in hand—and all of them help your clients’ marketing go further. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> By being proactive, you can help your clients get the services they need—before they even know they need them. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Preparing for growth before it happens </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> White-label marketing services might seem like a good idea right now. What if the job market switches? Does partnering with an outside team still make sense? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There’s reason to believe that hiring isn’t going to get any easier in the foreseeable future. First, many people who quit aren’t in any rush to get a new job. On top of that, Gen Z is now entering the workplace, and they’re bringing with them new attitudes toward work. They are less loyal and more likely to leave (Vox). </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Hiring is also an intensive process that can take weeks or even months to complete. Then there are the costs of training and onboarding a new employee. If they decide to leave shortly after, you’re right back to square one. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> White-label marketing services let you scale up instantly </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Hiring is costly and slow, which can then mean lost opportunities for your business. “Growing pains” affect plenty of businesses, even when the hiring market is full of talented job seekers. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> White-label marketing services are an effective way of dealing with those growing pains. The right partner can help your business avoid growing pains altogether. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Talent and expertise when you need it </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> How do white-label marketing services help your agency scale with ease? Your partner provider has an expert team on their side. That means they can add more helping hands to your team whenever you need them. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Your provider can draw on their talented team whenever you sign new clients to your business. Since these team members have experience, training takes less time. In most cases, they can start delivering for your new clients much sooner than a new hire can. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The end result is you already have a talented team to draw on as your business begins to scale up again. Better yet, your clients start getting the quality content they want sooner. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Discover what white-label marketing services can do for you </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> The world has changed, and hiring and retention changed with it. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Rethink your strategy to keep delivering on your promises to your clients. A white-label marketing services provider could be the answer you’ve been looking for.

A solid foundation gives you something durable to rely on as you carry your plans to fruition. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> So, what’s at the foundation of a great marketing strategy? Let’s take a look. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Foundational elements of a strong marketing strategy </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> A specific target audience </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Trying to sell to everyone is ineffective and wasteful, so it’s better to narrow your focus.

It’s important to name the specific objectives you want your business to achieve so you can create a marketing strategy that helps you get there. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With the right foundation in place, you can build an effective marketing strategy that creates a meaningful impact for your business. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;">   </span> </p> <p> <a href="https://resources.yourdigitalagency.com.au/p/foundation-for-a-marketing-strategy/" style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank"> Download the worksheet </a> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Ready to craft your marketing strategy? </span> </span> <a href="https://resources.yourdigitalagency.com.au/p/foundation-for-a-marketing-strategy/" style="display: initial;" target="_blank"> Download this worksheet to plan your brand’s strategy today </a> <span style="display: initial;"> .

<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-1277109.jpeg"/> </div> <div data-rss-type="text"> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> According to McKinsey &amp; Company, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) account for approximately  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 48 percent </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  of the economy. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> In times like these, SMBs are challenged to think of creative ways to stay in business by moving their operations online in order to continue servicing customers.  It’s a trend that’s in full swing today. According to Forbes, there has been a  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 129 percent year-over-year growth </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  in ecommerce orders in the United States and Canada. </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> However, the move to online can be daunting and overwhelming for many local businesses. We are here to help you by offering necessary tools and resources to make the transition to online easier. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3> <a href="/local-business-app" style="display: initial;"> Introducing your Local Online Business Toolkit </a> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.5em; letter-spacing: 0.5px;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> 1. Build an ecommerce website </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Ecommerce has  advantages over traditional in-store retail.  It helps break the barriers of being confined to and only doing business within a specific location. You gain new customers through the internet and it’s the first step to moving online. When it comes to helping businesses build their websites, digital marketing agencies should keep four elements in mind including choosing a domain name, a secure hosting option, a content management system, and a website builder.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> To add the capability of selling online, it’s also important to choose an ecommerce platform that enables the ability to build an online web store. Finding separate tools to address each of these elements could be overwhelming for both businesses and agencies.  However, there are several  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> all-in-one solutions </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  that make this task easier by offering professional website templates that are ecommerce-enabled and come with plug-and-play functions.  </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> These templates are also customizable and can be modified to suit specific business needs. The presence of easy-to-use visual builders like DiviBuilder eliminates the need for complex coding and makes customization simpler.From there, all businesses need to do is add products and services to an existing template, customize if necessary, and start selling online. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.5em; letter-spacing: 0.5px;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> 2. Manage online presence </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> According to an Uberall survey,  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 82 percent of mobile shoppers </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  conduct “near-me” or local searches for products and services on their smartphones.  Therefore, visibility on search engines like Google is essential for businesses to ensure customers can easily find them. Digital marketing agencies can help SMBs manage online presence through local listings management -- a process where vital business information, like name, business hours, address, contact details, and website details are continually updated on online directories. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> By using  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> listing builder solutions </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> , agencies can help businesses keep their listings information current, which can improve their search engine optimization (SEO) rank. This increases the likelihood of customers finding them through higher ranking on search engines. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Furthermore, agencies can also help businesses reduce the burden of tackling hundreds of online directories together and, by using add-ons, information can be updated instantly at all sources with just the click of a button. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.5em; letter-spacing: 0.5px;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> 3. Monitor online reputation </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Constant monitoring and management of a businesses’ online reputation is essential because approximately  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 95 percent of customers </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  read online reviews before making a purchase. However, managing reviews for numerous websites can require a great deal of effort and constant monitoring. Failing to respond to even a single negative review may lead to permanent harm and the loss of current and potential customers. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> The aggregation of all reviews from numerous online websites in one location, and the ability to respond to them right from that dashboard, helps businesses save time and effort by eliminating the need to visit those websites separately to respond. Businesses can see their average review score from all sources, compare that score with the industry average based on their competitors’ score, and take necessary action to improve. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> They can also get insights into the keywords that their customers use the most in their reviews while talking about their business. For example, if the keyword “customer service” is associated a lot with negative reviews, it means that customer service is lagging. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Finally, businesses can keep track of answers to the questions that customers might ask about your business on Google. Often these answers might be outdated or incorrect, in which case it may lead to your business losing customers. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.5em; letter-spacing: 0.5px;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> 4. Social media management </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> A total of  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 79 percent of the United States population </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  had a social networking profile in 2019, making social media an important tool for businesses to build and grow customer relationships. It’s also an important platform for receiving constructive customer feedback on business products and services, as well as addressing their complaints.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> But customers expect to get responses  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> in under 30 minutes </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  of posting, so it’s critical to stay on top of managing all social media platforms in a timely manner.  Doing so could be challenging for a business that has just transitioned online. Managing multiple social channels gets confusing and overwhelming, leading to lost messages and missed posts. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Digital marketing agencies can help businesses plug the gaps by using  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> social media solutions </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;">  to manage all channels from a single dashboard and schedule posts in advance so that you never miss a day if you’re away.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> You can also analyze relevant metrics, like reach and engagement, to determine the posts that are working and those that are not. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.5em; letter-spacing: 0.5px;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> 5. Gather online customer reviews </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Online reviews can have a direct impact on small business revenue. Therefore, a great way for businesses to get more customers is to simply ask existing ones to write a review about their experience. According to Womply, businesses with more than the average number of reviews across all review sites bring in  </span> <span style="display: initial;"> 54 percent more in annual revenue </span> <span style="display: initial; font-style: inherit;"> . </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="font-style: inherit; display: initial;"> Digital marketing agencies can use similar solutions to get more customer reviews for their business clients by creating personalized messages and connecting with these customers through either email or text messages. Customers can then be directed to third-party review websites and social media channels where they can leave reviews on public-facing platforms. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Ask us how we can help! </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>UTILISING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESS</title>

<description>Utilising Social Media For Business. Many companies today are shifting their marketing efforts to the online market. Read our blog to learn how to utilise social media for your business success.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/pexels/dms3rep/multi/pexels-photo-1545499.jpeg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Social media is at the heart of modern interaction, and that doesn’t seem like it’ll change any time soon. Every smartphone user today has access to at least one social media platform. Among these, Facebook, Twitter, Tik Tok &amp; WhatsApp, and Instagram are the most used sites today. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Due to the ever-growing number of social media users, many businesses have seen it as an opportunity to include these platforms in their marketing strategies. The results have shown that regardless of the company's industry, advertising products on Facebook, Twitter, and other relevant sites can have a significant impact on the total number of sales. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> So, how can you leverage the benefits of social media and grow your business? This article discusses several important tips you'll need to consider for your marketing strategy to succeed. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 1. Identify The Right Platform </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The first step towards the successful utilisation of social media is finding the best platform for your business. For instance, although all social media users are potential customers, those using Facebook could be more interested in your products than the rest. Therefore, you need to do your analysis and know the primary purpose of each of these sites. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> For example, Instagram is mainly about sharing photos and showcasing your photography skills. Twitter, on the other hand, hosts people who are mostly interested in breaking news and other informative posts. As such, there are high chances that users on each of these platforms have registered an account to enjoy the aforementioned benefits. It's upon you to do your research and know where you can find your ideal target audience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With this information in mind, you can then tailor your marketing strategy to fit the nature and needs of your potential customers. On Instagram, for instance, your posts must involve videos or interesting photos for them to attract any form of engagement.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 2. Utilise The Power Of Influencers </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Every social media website has influencers who are always willing to market businesses from different industries. It's worth noting that you can advertise any product through this method provided you get the right influencer. For instance, if you’re in the construction industry, you can hire influencers who are already into construction, engineering, architecture, or design. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The advantage of doing so is that such influencers already have a huge target audience who followed them because of the content they publish. Therefore, posting your brand or products on their social media handles means you’ll be able to reach many potential clients within a short period.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The quality of prospective customers you’re likely to get here is higher than those you’d get if you use your new social media accounts to market. Finding the right influencers and convincing them to work with you is perhaps the biggest challenge you’ll face. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are a number of methods you can use to attract their attention. The most effective of them all, though, is commenting and liking their posts regularly. This way, your name will become familiar to them and you can then start building a business relationship with them.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Of course, you can also inbox them as soon as you want to launch your marketing strategy. However, that’s not recommended because how you relate with your influencers can directly impact the success of this marketing project. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 3. Run Regular Competitions </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The benefits you’ll enjoy from social media highly depend on the number of engagements you initiate on these platforms. The more comments, shares, and likes you get, the higher your chances of succeeding in this area. So, how are you going to engage your customers more? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> One of the best techniques used by many companies is running competitions. You can set aside a small budget to compensate weekly or monthly winners. Of course, to market your brand even more, the prizes you give out can be your own products or services. For instance, if you’re in the fashion industry, you can use some clothes or other fashion products to attract attention. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Since this is a way of promoting your products, it’d be a good idea to use some of your best products in this marketing strategy. That way, you’ll be able to convert many potential clients to regular customers. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Social media platforms have become part and parcels of any modern business. Every company that’s looking to build its online presence uses this marketing method in one way or another. If you’re just starting, then the first thing you should do is identify the right platform and create an account with them. In addition to using your account to market products, you can also leverage the power of influencers. Lastly, running regular competitions can also help engage your followers and, ultimately, attract more potential clients. </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

Every agency owner wants it, but growth isn’t easy. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> We know how frustrating it is to face the challenges that come with expansion. You want $$$ but to get there, you have to find a way to scale reliably. Your team is stretched thin, so you turn towards hiring more staff or calling in an expensive consultant. But taking on more people means your operating expenses and overheads skyrocket. Not to mention the toll it takes on your time and stress levels.  To bring on a new employee, you spend hours onboarding them, managing their workload, supervising their timesheets, administering benefits, providing the tools they need to do the job, and the list goes on...and then they leave you for greener pastures. </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> For many agencies, these demands put a cap on how quickly they grow. You know you need to expand to keep up with client demand, but find yourself in a catch-22: you can’t grow without investing in new talent, but you can’t hire new talent without growing. Where do they go from here? </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <a href="https://flatratedigitalmarketing.com/customer/auth/register" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> CREATE A FREE ACCOUNT HERE TODAY </a> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.625rem;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What would you like to add to your business?

There's also monitoring for your on- and off-page activities to make sure there's organic traffic flowing through.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Not only that, we provide monthly reports once things get going to make sure you're up to date with everything that's going on. And of course, we won't charge you until your website is properly ranked. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Benefits of Pay-For-Performance SEO </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <br/> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> The biggest benefit of pay-for-performance SEO is that you won't have to risk much to get the SEO you want.

You'll also get better exposure overall with higher search engine rankings.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> All in all, pay-for-performance SEO means a much more reliable means of generating traffic for your site.

<title>THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO PAY FOR PERFORMANCE LOCAL SEO</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/the-ultimate-guide-to-pay-for-performance-local-seo</link>
<description>Pay-For-Performance Local SEO. People are searching on Google to find local businesses like yours. Learn more about it here.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/bigstock-Search-Seo-Online-Internet-Bro-104318468-1920x1342.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block; text-align: left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Most businesses can't seem to catch a break with their SEO. After trying to master local SEO marketing, many business owners turn to SEO agencies. They find themselves paying thousands of dollars a month without any results. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> What's worse is that some of these SEO agencies hurt your rankings. They may try outdated strategies such as PBN networks and vanity keywords. You're essentially paying these SEO companies to tank your website. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Ouch! </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If you got burned in the past, but still need help with your SEO, a Pay-For-Performance agency is your best bet. This new model shifts all of the risk from the business owner to the SEO agency. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> What Is Pay-For-Performance SEO? </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <br/> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Remember the last time you paid for a service that got fulfilled poorly? It's not the best feeling. Manipulative SEO agencies can siphon thousands of dollars by the time you realize you got a bad deal. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Pay-For-Performance SEO turns this model on its head. Instead of paying for people's labor, you pay for results. If you don't get results, you don't pay. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Pay-For-Performance SEO agencies get incentivized to care about your success. If they fail to produce results, they won't  </span> <a href="https://smallbusinessify.com/how-to-stay-relevant-in-business/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> stay in business </a> <span style="display: initial;">  for long. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Warning Signs of a Sketchy Agency </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <br/> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Pay-For-Performance SEO is a revolutionary concept designed to help business owners. However, some manipulators using the old agency model found a back door. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Look out for SEO agencies with a pay scale based on organic traffic generated. These agencies will send artificial traffic rather than qualified leads. This artificial traffic will lower your bounce rate. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Low  </span> <a href="https://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/7-ways-to-reduce-bounce-rate-and-increase-your-conversions" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> bounce rates </a> <span style="display: initial;">  will hurt your search rankings. and you'll essentially pay the SEO agency to damage your website's SEO. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Take on the role of a proactive prospect. Ask questions such as which keywords they will target for your brand. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't trust them if they won't share details or act secretive when you ask questions. An SEO agency represents a significant investment. If they aren't upfront with you, don't hand over your  </span> <a href="https://gatheringdreams.com/how-to-make-an-extra-100-fast/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> hard-earned money </a> <span style="display: initial;"> .  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Keywords are the foundation of any SEO strategy. You deserve to know their rationale for selecting keywords. If you have a target keyword in mind, present it to the SEO agency. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> What to Look for in an Agency </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <br/> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> The best Pay-For-Performance SEO agencies focus on  </span> <a href="https://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/setting-smart-goals" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> realistic goals </a> <span style="display: initial;">  and transparency. You won't hit Page 1 tomorrow, and it can take a few weeks to see momentum. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> That's not the agency's fault. SEO takes time. Google needs to trust your website and rank it above other web pages over time.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Transparent agencies will tell you what they're doing for your website. They will also share how their actions are getting you closer to the first page for your keyword. </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Ready to Boost Your SEO? </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 1.3em;"> <br/> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> An SEO agency is an investment in your business. You should only invest if you see results.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <br/> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.7em;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Your Digital Agency is a Pay-For-Performance SEO agency.

<title>POST COVID MARKETING TRENDS FOR YOUR SMALL BUSINESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/post-covid-marketing-trends-for-your-small-business</link>
<description>The pandemic has affected the world economy in so many different ways. Since it hit the shoreline of Australia, people have changed the way they spend their money. As a result, businesses must also change the way they reach consumers or clients. While marketing hasn’t undergone drastic changes, there have been big shifts in digital marketing trends post-Covid.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1599704999257-c6f1d48119a6.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The pandemic has affected the world economy in so many different ways . Since it hit the shoreline of Australia, people have changed the way they spend their money. As a result, businesses must also change the way they reach consumers or clients. While marketing hasn’t undergone drastic changes, there have been big shifts in digital marketing trends post-Covid.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> 1. Digital ads are increasing  </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Thanks to lockdowns across the country, digital ad space has been in high demand. Both consumers and  </span> <a href="https://info.partica.com/how-content-marketing-helps-small-businesses/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> businesses </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;">  have had to look to the internet meaning businesses have needed to increase their digital ad spending thanks to the loss of foot traffic and in-store visitors. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> According to a recent survey of Australian retailers, Facebook and Instagram were the top platforms where businesses spent more money on their digital advertising. Post-Covid, shopping online is becoming more normalised with consumers and businesses are both migrating to the digital space. As a result, the competition for ad space on social media platforms, has increased. This makes it more difficult to be heard through the noise, but it does lower the cost-per-click. It’s more important now to optimise your digital ad campaigns to make sure you’re getting value for money in your digital marketing campaign.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> 2. Video is becoming more powerful  </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Thanks to an increase in screen time,  video is helping to break up the monotony in social media feeds. Consequently, video ads have grown 18 per cent in the past quarter. And  </span> <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/" target="_blank" style="display: initial; text-decoration: none;"> 56 per cent of marketer </a> <span style="display: initial; text-decoration: none;"> s </span> <span style="display: initial;">  plan on experimenting with live video by the end of the year. Video has been growing in popularity in the past few years and the pandemic isn’t slowing that momentum down. The real estate industry was one of the first to see the value in video, using it to enhance engagement on property listings. Now every industry should be tapping into video to reach and engage social media users. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> 3. Consumers are craving convenience </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> While consumer loyalty is still an important marketing tool, post-Covid has changed the buying behaviours of Australians. A combination of more stressful financial times, a lack of confidence in being in public, and social distancing rules has caused this shift in buying behaviour. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Extras such as flexible payment options and affordable or free shipping are what consumers are now looking for when choosing a brand to trust. As a business, you’ll need to make it easy for potential clients to find you online and to clearly understand what services you offer.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> 4. Influencer marketing is growing  </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As consumers and social media users begin to crave authenticity, influencer marketing has been growing steadily since the beginning of the Covid pandemic. Users are after a personal connection with a brand or company which is a likely byproduct of lockdowns and social distancing measures. Influencer campaigns can provide opportunities on social media with smaller budgets, </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> 5. Not ignoring the pandemic  </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Despite what you might think about the pandemic, your clients don’t want you to stop talking about it. Instead, consumers are looking for businesses who can assure them that they are taking measures to keep them safe. The hospitality industry has done this well since the pandemic began, welcoming back customers by strictly following pandemic protocols and offering refunds for hotel stays that are cancelled due to closing borders. By putting your restrictions and commitment to public safety front and center, you can reassure your brand credibility. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> While some of the marketing trends have changed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they aren’t completely new. All you need to do is re-evaluate where you should be prioritising your budget, especially when it comes to digital advertising.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>CURATED CONTENT AND MARKETING</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/curated-content-and-marketing</link>
<description>What exactly is curated content, and how can you use it to your advantage on social media?</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1546833998-877b37c2e5c6.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Curated content can help to improve  brand engagement and  credibility, without blowing out your marketing budget. But what exactly is curated content, and how can you use it to your advantage on social media? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> What is curated content? </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Curated content refers to content that has been written and produced by someone other than you. Rather than creating your own content, such as blog articles, you can share others content purchase, add your own unique voice and share it with your audience. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> The content you curate should focus on generating engagement with your brand, building your brand awareness and building your brand credibility and authority, rather than drive business sales. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> The content you find to curate should be relevant to your business and area of expertise. It should add value to your audience. The purpose of curated content is to offer insight or knowledge into the things you do or the industry you’re in. It shouldn’t promote your business in any way. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The form of content you can curate and share can be in the form of infographics, blog articles, webinars, how-to videos, expert tips, and so on. While curated content has been around for years, many businesses have avoided using it. But whether you’re an established brand in your industry or you’re just starting out, it can be a powerful digital marketing tool.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Why should I use curated content?  </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Curated content can enhance your social media marketing strategy by helping you maintain a full content calendar, provide helpful and valuable resources to your audience and help to connect you and your brand with influencers and industry leaders. Sharing curated content to your social media pages also helps increase your brand credibility by helping you stay on track with industry trends. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Best of all, you don’t have to spend the time or money researching and creating the content yourself. While curated content is easier to share as it’s less time consuming, it’s important to make sure you are choosing quality over quantity. It’s all good and well to have a full content calendar, but it won’t mean much if you’re not sharing content that is relevant to your followers.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Marketing benefits of curated content  </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> By sharing a diverse range of content sources, even from competitor brands, you can enhance your brand identity in the eyes of your past, current and potential clients. Being selective in the content you share gives you the opportunity to create a brand image that is trustworthy, knowledgeable and credible. Curating content also gives you the opportunity to be more visual with your digital marketing. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Digital marketing has undergone many changes throughout the years and one of those is influencer marketing. Social media users continue to increasingly trust the opinions of influencers they follow instead of trusting the product plugs and recommendations from high-profile celebrities. This doesn’t mean you need to send out free products to Instagram influencers. Instead, curated content gives you the opportunity to share content from trusted industry bloggers or YouTubers who happen to be influencers for your industry. Sharing Facebook posts, Instagram videos or tweets from industry leaders can help you build relationships with people your audience already trusts.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Where can I find curated content?  </span> </h2> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h2> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> One of the first places to look for curated content is within your industry. Who are the leaders in your industry and the voices your audience are following and trusting when it comes to information? By sharing the content created by these thought leaders, you can enhance your brand identity as a trusted source too.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> User-Generated Content </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Sometimes overlooked as an effective marketing tool, user-generated content can be a great way to showcase your products or services on your social media pages. For example, Instagram is a visual platform and sharing user-generated content on the platform can help you create a visual brand image without needing to spend the time or money on creating that visual content yourself. But whether it’s on Instagram or other social media pages, you can share user-generated content to showcase and inspire brand loyalty, create brand credibility and promote authenticity. Client decisions are more heavily based on reviews and recommendations from trusted sources and user-generated content can provide that for you.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 2.5rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Curated content dos and don’ts  </span> </h2> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Dos </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Add your own unique voice and comments </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Always credit the source - this will help you build those relationships too </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Be selective in your content and only choose content that is going to add value to your marketing strategy  </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Use SEO keywords to optimise the content for your brand </span> </li> </ul> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Don’ts </span> </h3> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Avoid having your own say or sharing your own expert opinion </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Be overly promotional </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Sacrifice quality over quantity </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Stick to the same few sources - mix it up </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Just copy and paste the content </span> </li> </ul> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Curated content can help you enhance your brand identity, credibility and engagement with your audience.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>SETTING SMART GOALS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/setting-smart-goals</link>
<description>Your Digital Marketing and Content SMART goals should be targets that you aim to achieve over a set period of time. These goals, much like your other business goals, should be put together to ensure they’re achievable and realistic.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1590845947667-381579052389.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Your Digital Marketing and Content SMART goals should be targets that you aim to achieve over a set period of time. These goals, much like your other business goals, should be  put together to ensure they’re achievable and realistic.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> What is a SMART goal? </span> </h4> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The "SMART" acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Each SMART goal you create should have these five characteristics to help you make content goals that are designed to be achieved successfully. If your goals are too abstract or if you don't set a realistic deadline to complete your SMART goal, you may fall short of what you want to accomplish with your digital marketing content marketing strategy.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4> <span style="display: initial;"> How to make your SMART goal </span> </h4> <h3 style="line-height: 2rem; letter-spacing: 0.06rem;"> <br/> </h3> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bolder;"> Use specific wording </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> It’s important to make sure your SMART goal is specific. This means there needs to be a destination you are aiming to get to. “Sharing better content” isn’t a SMART goal because it is too abstract and broad. Instead, ask yourself why your content is getting better. How will you be sharing this content and what do you want to gain from sharing it? For example, “blog traffic will increase from Facebook posts.” </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bolder;"> Make sure  goals are measurable </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> SMART goals should  be measurable so you can track and quantify the goal's progress. Let’s go back to our specific goal of “blog traffic will increase from Facebook posts.” To make this SMART goal measurable, you need to set yourself a target. How much traffic should you be aiming for? Remember that you need to be realistic here. For example, “increase blog traffic by 5 per cent from Facebook posts.” </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bolder;"> Are your goals realistic and attainable? </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> To create an attainable SMART goal, you need to consider your ability to achieve it. If we look at our previous SMART goal example, you’ll need to make sure that the percentage of increase is realistic and attainable for your business. So, if your blog traffic increased by 5 per cent last month, you might want to try and increase it by 10 per cent this month. You need to base your goals off your own analytics and not industry benchmarks so you can accurately measure their success and achieve those goals. </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bolder;"> Pick goals that are relevant and relate to your business </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> If you create SMART goals that are relevant to your company's overall business goals, they will account for current trends in your industry. If you do grow traffic to your blog from your Facebook posts, will this lead to more revenue? And is it going to be possible for you to significantly work this SMART goal into your current email marketing campaigns? </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bolder;"> Include a deadline </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> Including a deadline in your SMART goal helps to keep you on track to achieving in. You don’t want your goal to take too long, but it needs to be long enough to measure its success properly. This will also help you make consistent and significant progress in the long term. For example, the previous SMART goal “increase blog traffic by 5 per cent from Facebook posts” would become something similar to “increase blog traffic by 5 per cent per month from Facebook posts in the next six months.” </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Now that you know how to create a content SMART goal, it’s time to do just that. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> Remember that your goals need to align with both your business goals and your overall marketing strategy. They should be designed to support and help achieve your overall marketing goals. </span> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>ADVANTAGES OF OUTSOURCING YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/digital-marketing-5-advantages-of-outsourcing-your-social-media</link>
<description>It's likely your business will feel it needs to have a digital marketing strategy, and social media will be a large part of that. However, getting social media right is so important to your brand, and you may feel that you don't have the time or expertise for that.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1606422718307-7ab02064d541.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It's likely your business will feel it needs to have a digital marketing strategy, and social media will be a large part of that. However, getting social media right is so important to your brand, and you may feel that you don't have the time or expertise for that. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It's also true that hiring a dedicated social media manager is likely to be more expensive than outsourcing your activity to a marketing agency. Therefore, this article will look at the subject in more detail. Discussing some of the main advantages of outsourcing and debunking the myth that you need to manage these things yourself for success. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Frees up your time to work on other aspects of your business </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you're running your business with a small team or maybe even doing everything yourself, then your time is going to be incredibly precious. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Getting social media right means being able to create stunning visuals and to update your profiles regularly. It may even mean posting during unusual hours if you're trying to reach a global audience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Understandably, you may think your time is better spent on generating customer business and other forms of marketing. However, social media can also help towards those goals, so it's worth spending a decent amount on it through a marketing agency. In this way, you can see the benefits without taking time away from your business. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Keeps your social media active if you want to take a break </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you are running your business by yourself, then there may be times when you want to take a break. The problem though is that leaving your social media accounts quiet during this period can lead to followers and engagement levels dropping off. So, this means you may want to manage a lot of your social media yourself but utilise an agency during certain times. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When you do this, it will still appear that your business is operating normally even if you are taking a break. So, when you are ready to get back to work, you won't have lost followers or momentum that you then need to get back. As a rule, it's a good idea to keep things active the whole time, and outsourcing is a useful way of accomplishing that. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Outsourcing as an educational tool </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It may be that you don't want someone to manage your social media content for you but need some help to get started. There's a variety of social media services you can get, such as merely getting accounts set-up in the first place. Presentation counts so getting this ready through a professional is a good idea. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You may also need help in deciding what times are best to post or the sort of content you should be putting out there. Hiring a social media consultant can help you with that, and they can also give your accounts an audit, so you know what you're getting right or wrong. Getting this expertise, in the beginning, can be crucial to avoid making elementary mistakes that could be hugely damaging to your brand. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Social media isn't all about selling </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The last point touched a bit on mistakes that you can make. More specifically, one of those mistakes that new brands often make is thinking social media is purely a sales tool. Therefore, they post promoted content infrequently. The two problems with this is you're trying to sell rather than engage, and you aren't updating your accounts regularly. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Any followers or fans will wonder the reasons they should purchase from you with no knowledge of your brand and an account that doesn't even appear to be active. As a rule, social media is not a place for the hard sell - and encouraging engagement should be your way forward. By outsourcing, the agency or freelancer you use should know this and make sure you are getting your digital marketing output right. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Getting social media right is an art </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You may have played around on social media before and think you can efficiently run your brand accounts. Keep in mind though that getting things right is an art form, and you might be better off outsourcing it to a team of professionals that work on this sort of thing every day. As mentioned in other points, you want to be careful not to damage your brand through elementary mistakes. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> For example, social media is about your audience, so a good social media manager will tailor your offering for that specific audience. Of course, this involves going through social media and Google Analytics to zero in on their interests. It's equally worth remembering, the best successful social media brands use stunning visuals, and you need to be comfortable creating them, so this may be different to the Facebook status updates you are used to posting. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Most brands now realise the importance of a robust digital marketing strategy and the role social media has in that. The significant decision though is on whether you manage that in house or look to outsource it. Of course, there is no right or wrong answer to that it just depends on your individual circumstances.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Remember though if you do choose to outsource it frees up your time for other aspects of your business, keeps your social media active if you want to take a break, outsourcing can be used as an educational tool, social media isn't all about selling and getting things right is an art. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If you need help with your Social Media, </span> </span> <a href="/contact" style="display: initial;"> please get in touch at Your Digital Agency </a> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>7 WAYS TO REDUCE BOUNCE RATE</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/7-ways-to-reduce-bounce-rate-and-increase-your-conversions</link>
<description>High bounce rates can seriously hurt your website's conversion rate and limit its ability to grow. Keep reading below to understand what is bounce rate and what you can do to reduce it in your site.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1555719762-671ca39b6fb0.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Whether you're trying to sell a product or make a name for yourself online, the point of any website is to attract internet traffic. But what if your visitors decide they've had enough after only glancing at your landing page? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> High bounce rates can seriously hurt your website's conversion rate and limit its ability to grow. Keep reading below to understand what is bounce rate and what you can do to reduce it in your site. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What is bounce rate? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The bounce rate is a metric that measures the percentage of users who land on any of your site's pages and leave without having visited other pages on the same domain. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Having a high bounce rate often means you don't have an enticing landing page that promotes user navigation. That being said, a site's bounce rate is best understood when compared with other useful metrics, such as dwell time and scroll depth. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> So, what can you do to optimise your website's bounce rate? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Optimise page load time </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It's easy to assume that a high bounce rate is caused by unengaging content. However, the truth is that if your page takes forever to load, you could be driving away possible customers before they've had the chance to see your products. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> According to research carried by Akamai Technologies, more than 47% of users expect a site to load in two seconds or less. A fact which is especially true for mobile versions, as even a speed delay on only 500 milliseconds can decrease engagement by as much as 8%. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Improve your content's readability </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As you can guess, poor user experience is one of the leading causes behind high bounce rates. If your content is unreadable, either due to bad grammar or formatting, then chances your visitors will run for the hills. After all, who has time to waste on a when the internet is full of more exciting pages? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Optimise your site for readability and make sure you got the basics covered. Don't use large blocks of text which could scare readers away. Instead, use an easy-to-read format in your posts, use subheadings and bullet points as often as you can, insert attractive images and charts where appropriate, and make use of a conversational and engaging style in your writing. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Have a clear call to action </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Whether a visitor leaves or stays is decided in a matter of seconds. That's why your site should explain what you're selling as soon as it finishes loading. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When building your content, never leave your call to action at the bottom of the page where users will have to scroll down to see it. Instead, make it the focus of attention of your page and write it so your visitors know exactly what steps they should take to get the products they need. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Target abandoning users </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Despite your best efforts, a percentage of your visitors will always leave without seeing any other page. That's just a fact of life. However, you can increase the chances of making a sell or turning them into subscribers by using exit intent advertisements. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Using an exit intent popup, you can track when a visitor is about to leave and display a targeted message at that precise moment. This message could contain a discount code, to convince the user to finish a sale, or a subscription invitation, which would allow you to send the customer relevant offers. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Show social proof </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Consumers seem to be getting savvier by the day, meaning you'll need more than sweet talk to make a sale. Research shows that, after deciding which product they want, consumers often lurk around to find out what previous clients have to say about your site. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You can make users comfortable with trusting you their money and information by proudly displaying what your clients and review sites have to say about you. Don't forget to put time into making your site as secure as possible, as this makes people feel at ease when handing out their credit card and personal information. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Blog consistently </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Blogging new material every week is a good SEO practice. Not only does it generate a steady supply of leads, as in 126% more than if you didn't blog, according to HubSpot, but also builds the trust necessary to convert new visitors into repeat visitors. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Once your bounce rate starts falling and your repeat visitors exceed new visitors, you'll begin to see a notable improvement in your conversion rate, especially if you are continuously pumping powerful, engaging material that is relevant to them. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Reword your product pages </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Writing product descriptions is an art form. Go into too much detail, and you risk confusing your readers. On the other hand, put too little information, and they'll feel they don't know enough to make a purchase. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Bounce rates for product pages are usually higher than average. However, if you're noticing that you're not making enough conversions, try testing whether adding more information helps. Some of the key things your visitors might want to know include where was the product manufactured, what's your return policy, and what are your customers saying about the product. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> So those where seven ways to reduce your bounce rate and increase your conversions. It is important to remember that when optimising your site, you should build it using high-quality content. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't just focus on the metrics, but rather create a site which offers a seamless navigation experience, useful content, quick loading speeds, and attractive product pages. Do that, and you'll see how quickly your site starts to grow once word of mouth from your faithful visitors spreads. </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>WORDPRESS OR SHOPIFY?</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/wordpress-or-shopify-how-to-choose-the-best-platform-for-your-site</link>
<description>WP vs Shopify: The Verdict. Both have excellent options for building your online business. But, only WordPress will let you have complete control throughout its growth. We'd love to show you what's possible with the platform. And, help you see the long-term benefits of WP vs Shopify and others. Let's work together on building something great.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1517701221265-7da25447217b.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Are you trying to choose a platform for your website? Learn about key facts that will help you when choosing WordPress or Shopify. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> WordPress and Shopify offer fantastic options for building an online presence. Yet, should you choose WordPress or Shopify for your online store? Decisions, decisions! </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Let's look at why you would use one platform over the other. And, hopefully, reach a consensus so you can get started building your online store. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> WordPress or Shopify: Which is Best? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You've got dozens of great online platforms to choose from, all vying for your attention. It's easy getting wrapped up in bullet points touting features. What you should look for is the three most essential items: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ol> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Price </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Features </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Support </span> </li> </ol> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> WordPress is an open-source platform whereas Shopify is a product. Both have extensive features for building online stores. And, the support for the two is industry-defining. This makes the decision all-too-difficult! </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Here are the real differences coming from experience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Price </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> While WordPress is open source meaning it's truly free. Of course, there are expenses for both platforms you'll want to compare. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Consider what it takes to set up a store with WordPress: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Domain </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Hosting </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> eCommerce plugin </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Then compare it to Shopify: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Domain </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Subscription </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Transaction fees </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Extra transaction fees (if you're not using Shopify Payments) </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It's the payment processing fees you'll want to consider! This may not seem like much in the beginning but what if you start selling thousands of products? With WP, you have more payment options to fit your size and scaling. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You'll also want to compare pricing for: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Themes </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Plugins </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Extensions </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Each platform offers free themes, plugins, and extensions. Though, WordPress often includes more affordable options. You'll want to consider the follow-up support, too, when upgrading your store as time goes on. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Features </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The base features of WordPress and Shopify are drastic. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> WordPress is "barebones" from its base installation. You'll configure most aspects of the site from its structure to design. You'll also install eCommerce plugins to start supporting your online store. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Shopify, in comparison, is an all-in-one solution. Sign up and you'll have everything needed to begin selling online after a few tweaks. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Consider: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <ul> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Themes: More available for WP but Shopify's are simpler to use </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> SEO: Shopify offers built-in SEO whereas WP often requires plugins </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Updates: Both should auto-update given you have great hosting </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Interface: Shopify is a bit easier to understand on its backend </span> </li> <li> <span style="display: initial;"> Control: WordPress gives you unlimited control over its code </span> </li> </ul> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You'll likely find Shopify easier to use when installing extra features. Though, this is because there are fewer options to choose from. The larger install base of WP means you'll find more features to choose from. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Support </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> WordPress powers 30% of the Web so it's not going anywhere. Shopify has its ample share (around 600k) but no way has the reach WP does. Shopify can fail along with the company leaving its users SOL. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> That said: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> WordPress offers extensive support via documentation and online tutorials. It also spurred thousands of businesses providing WP services. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Shopify offers 1st and 3rd party support and extensive documentation. It's also less likely you'll "screw up" a Shopify store because it's hosted. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You'll find more malicious types attacking WordPress because it's widely used. Though, its popularity means more support from the whole community. WP and Shopify tie in this area as both have passionate communities supporting them. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> WP vs Shopify: The Verdict </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Deciding WordPress or Shopify comes down to this: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Both platforms are rather easy-to-use once setup and configured. Both have excellent options for building your online business. But, only WordPress will let you have complete control throughout its growth. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> We'd love to show you what's possible with the platform. And, help you see the long-term benefits of WP vs Shopify and others. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Let's work together on building something great.

<title>GEOFENCING AND MARKETING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/geofencing-and-marketing-what-you-need-to-know</link>
<description>How To Implement Geofencing Into Your Digital Marketing Strategy. Level up your local marketing efforts.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1578268456435-a14832813cf1.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> When a hungry person looks for somewhere to eat, you can bet they’d choose the nearest place in their vicinity. They won’t drive 30 minutes or an hour out to a great place they know if there is somewhere nearer that can meet their needs and temporarily provide them satisfaction. That goes the same way for any kind of product or service. More often than not, consumers want to find a product or service provider within their vicinity. The nearer and the faster their wants and needs are met, the better. That’s why location-based marketing has become such an important part of marketing strategies for most brands.  </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> Location-based marketing gives marketers and advertisers a unique opportunity to reach customers in specific locations which are especially helpful for brands with physical stores. Instead of basing it on likes and follows on social media, marketers reach new potential customers based on real-world visits. This ensures that they reach the right audience with a relevant message at the right time.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> With geofencing, marketers and advertisers can target audiences with customized targeting shapes that have remarkable precision. While this is not a new concept, its popularity in the marketing world has continued to grow in the previous years. Here’s everything you need to know about it.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> What Is Geofencing? <br/> </span> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Geofencing is a location-based targeting option that allows you to create a virtual boundary around a certain location to reach potential customers.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> Think of it in three steps. First, you create the bubble or the virtual perimeter. The diameter can be as small as the size of a corner store or several miles wide like an industrial operation. Then, a customer enters that area. Afterward, an app or software would use Wi-Fi, GPS, cellular data, or radio frequency identification (RFID) to send some form of marketing option to the customer’s mobile device like a social media advertisement, text, app notification, or email.  </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> A simple example is when a woman passes by a Zara shop at the mall and receives an app notification or a social media ad saying “Today only! 30% to 50% off on select items!” </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> While it is mostly used for instant location-based advertising, geofencing can also be used to identify and build your audience over time and it can even help in attribution, retargeting, and other location-based insights.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Mobile Social Geofencing </span> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Geofencing has completely taken mobile and social marketing to the next level. From interactive shopping lists and limited-time offers for your favorite restaurant to suggestions for new restaurants or shops you haven’t tried before, geofencing offers a whole new world to discover for mobile users.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Geofencing Statistics </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If you’re looking to get into more hyper-targeted, location-based marketing, geofencing can produce incredible results for you. Just take a look at these statistics: </span> </p> <ul> <li style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Most consumers spend an average of </span> </span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/u-s-consumers-now-spend-5-hours-per-day-on-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> 5 hours </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> each day on their phones. </span> </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.38;"> <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads/418831/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> 71% </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> of consumers prefer personalized ads </span> </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.38;"> <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/best-practices/geofencing-marketing/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> 53% </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> of shoppers visited a business after receiving a location-based message </span> </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.38;"> <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/location-based-marketing-will-rely-mobile-2017/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> 3 out of 4 </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> consumers completed an action after receiving a location-based message </span> </span> </li> <li style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Geofencing influenced mobile ads have </span> </span> <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/research/14731.html" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> double </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> the click-through rate </span> </span> </li> </ul> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <br/> </p> <h3 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Using Geofencing To Its Fullest Potential </span> </h3> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> As effective geofencing as it is on its own, there is more it can do for your overall marketing campaign when used properly and in partnership with other marketing strategies and tools. One of those strategies is using behavioral targeting specifically focused on mobile advertising to segment consumers based on the data of their actions and geographic movements gathered from geofencing. With this, you can further narrow down your target mobile customers based on things like the number of visits they made to a retail store, where they spend most of their time, their downloads, and the like.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> Another means you can use alongside geofencing to increase the efficiency of your data gathering for your marketing is conversion zones. These are customizable geofences that are placed around a set area often in the vicinity of the advertiser’s locations that count how many customers have received someone’s ads. These customers can then be physically tracked to determine if they visited the business or not. With this, you can determine how effective your geofencing targeted ads are. Aside from these, there are plenty more aspects of your marketing that can be boosted with geofencing. It simply takes a bit more innovation and creativity.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h2 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> How To Implement Geofencing Into Your Marketing Strategy </span> </h2> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> One of the biggest benefits of incorporating geofencing into your marketing efforts is that it allows you to level up your local marketing efforts. With geofencing, you can target more local customers and send promotions or push notifications that can change each day or have limited-time offers that can help increase sales. It also allows you to collect data to personalize your offers. And last but not least, it helps you to track and measure your local sales.  </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> Incorporating geofencing into your marketing strategy doesn’t take much. All you need are GPS coordinates, an app, and a proactive approach. Here are some tips to help you get started. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Understand Your Customer Demographics </span> </h4> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Before anything, it is important that you understand who your local customers actually are and their demographics. This makes sure that you are talking to the right people and that you will get the results you want.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Keep It Close </span> </h4> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> You don’t want your geofence to be spread out too thin. The general rule is to keep it at a four to five minute maximum travel radius. This means that if they’re driving, it’s a four to five minute transport distance and if they’re walking, it’s a four to five minute walk time.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Be Transparent </span> </h4> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Respecting your customer’s privacy is a top priority. Make sure you inform them upfront that you have access to their information especially when they’re using an app and earn their trust. Make them feel comfortable and give them the confidence to use the app and return in the future.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Add Other Targeting Techniques </span> </h4> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Geofencing works much better when partnered with other targeting techniques. Options like content targeting, retargeting, context targeting, and day parting help you target various specific audience groups.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <h4 style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: 400;"> Optimize Your Campaigns </span> </h4> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> There are plenty of optimizing tools that can help you fine-tune your geofencing efforts as well as your campaigns. In addition to those, you should always present a clear, strong, and immediate call to action. Remember, your goal is to catch people at the right moment and advertise to get them into your location immediately. </span> </span> </p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;"> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> If you would like to implement a Geo Marketing Campaign for your business, get in touch with us for a chat! </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>4 MOST EFFECTIVE LEAD GENERATION TACTICS FOR 2021</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/4-most-effective-lead-generation-tactics-for-2021</link>
<description>Looking for up-to-date inbound marketing strategies that will help you grow your business? Discover 4 of the most effective lead generation tactics for 2021.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1598644612563-82fbfa1bf2dd.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Generating leads has always been essential to the success and growth of your business. However, as the world evolves, so do the best ways to earn high-quality leads. For example, while traditional outbound marketing strategies like cold calling used to be a great way to generate leads, today, an inbound marketing strategy is more effective, engaging, and relevant to the consumer.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Looking for up-to-date strategies that will help you grow your business?  Discover 4 of the most effective lead generation tactics for 2021.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Social Media </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Not only does an effective social media strategy increase brand awareness, but it's a great way to engage and connect with consumers. There are many different social media platforms where your business can reach your target consumers.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Facebook Ads </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> With </span> </span> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/#:~:text=With%20roughly%202.8%20billion%20monthly,most%20popular%20social%20network%20worldwide." style="display: initial;" target="_blank"> approximately 2.8 billion active users, </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Facebook is a popular platform to advertise on. Facebook ads target relevant audiences by allowing you to create customized targeting settings based on demographics, interests, and behaviours. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> What’s more, Facebook ads can be created in many different types of formats, including stories, newsfeed posts, single images, carousel images, or videos—you can pick the format that best suits the message you want to convey and best resonates with your audience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> LinkedIn Ads </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> LinkedIn ads are great for B2B business, as many of their target audience will be on this platform. Similar to Facebook, LinkedIn ads target specific audiences based on location, demographics, industries, and more. Again, like Facebook, LinkedIn allows you to create ads in different formats, such as carousel images, video, text posts, and more. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Instagram Ads </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Instagram is a constantly growing platform—the pool for potential high-quality leads will just continue to grow when you advertise on this platform. Furthermore, Facebook and Instagram are connected platforms, so targeting the correct audience is easy since you can use Facebook data to target certain audiences. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Google Ads </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Google ads bring your business to the top of the search page and attract the attention of prospects. Google is the number one search engine in the world, so therefore your ads will have an extremely large reach. You can target your ideal audience by what keywords they are searching as well—so you aren’t targeting people who don’t want to be targeted. You are targeting those who are actively searching for your product or service as a solution to their problem. The result? An increased likeness of generating leads and, in turn, an increase in your sales. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Content Marketing </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> SEO optimized content can attract high-quality leads to your website by bringing them to your page organically through search engines. Content can cater to customers in every stage of the buyer’s journey as well. For example, if you are a car dealership, you can cater to those in the beginning stages of buying a car by writing a helpful article on the benefits of buying vs. leasing a car. For prospects in the later stages of the buyer’s journey, you can create a more specific piece that goes over the impressive specs and features of one of your new models.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> By creating an ideal mix of promotional and non-promotional content, this type of marketing is a great way to generate high-quality leads. This is because content marketing positions your business as a trusted and knowledgeable industry leader, making it more likely that consumers will feel comfortable doing business with your company. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Chatbots and AI </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Chatbots and AI are relatively new ways to generate leads. This tactic increases your lead generation by offering a better customer experience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> For one, AI and chatbots enhance the customer experience by offering faster response rates to customers and potential leads. These quicker response times will make for a more convenient and pleasant experience for the prospect, while also showing the prospect that they are valued by your company.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Secondly, AI also offers better customer service through its ability to create a more personalized experience for prospects. AI can analyse the data of those who visit your website and relay specific messages and prompts to certain users. This creates a more seamless, streamlined experience for these website visitors, which, in turn, makes it more likely that they will convert into leads. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Get Started on These Lead Generation Strategies and See Your Business Grow </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The world—especially the digital world—is constantly evolving. Therefore, your business needs to keep up with these changes in order to continue to thrive. If you are looking to generate more leads and revenue for your business, consistently implementing these strategies are effective ways to reach these crucial business goals. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Looking for more information on how to create the best lead generation strategy for your unique business?

<title>INFLUENCER MARKETING</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/important-influencer-marketing-statistics</link>
<description>Influencer marketing is the fastest-growing advertising model on the internet right now, and justifiably so. The ROI for this type of marketing beats out more established marketing models,</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1576827471288-0a8f6d6c937b.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Influencer marketing is the fastest growing advertising model on the internet right now, and justifiably so.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The ROI for this type of marketing beats out more established marketing models, such as pay per click (PPC), old-school static banner ads or display ads, search engine marketing (SEM), search engine optimisation (SEO), video ads, non-influencer driven social media advertising, affiliate marketing, and opt-in email marketing.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The article below will walk you through a credible assortment of influencer marketing related statistics that will illustrate just how effective this new model of online marketing really is. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> The Highest ROI Statistics </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> According to the latest statistics published, brands are reportedly seeing $6 returns for every $1 spent on influencer driven marketing, an out of this world ROI that you will not find with any other ad model out there. It has also recently been reported that influencer marketers typically deliver 11 times higher ROI than all other forms of digital marketing. Regarding purchase intent, an influencer typically drives over 5 times higher rates in this metric when cross-compared to non-influencer driven forms of social media marketing. You will not find this level of ROI in any other on or offline advertising model. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A figure likely to surprise most people is that influencer driven marketing is now an industry worth over a billion dollars in collective ad revenue alone. The sales driven bottom-line that influencers are generating for their ad clients is in the tens of billions of dollars, with over 55 percent of women stating that they primarily make online purchases after hearing about the product or service through an influencer. All of the aforementioned statistics above firmly place influencer driven marketing at the very top of the advertising ROI food chain. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> The Highest Rates of User Engagement </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When it comes to user engagement rates, this is the metric where influencer driven marketing shines the brightest. For example, Instagram influencers typically see an audience engagement rate that is nearly 12 times higher than what a static website can generate. Regarding social media, one-third of Millennials state that they regularly engage with the content of a popular Instagram or Twitter influencer every time they get online. Furthermore, over 48 percent of women claim to interact with an Instagram brand because an influencer recommended it. These user engagement statistics are not only high compared to engagement rates commanded by other forms of online media, but they are also at a level that is unheard of in any advertising model that has ever existed in human history. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Phenomenal Influencer Reach </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When it comes to user reach, social media influencers are starting to dwarf age-old television personalities by wide margins. As any influencer management expert will tell you, influencers represent new media and they possess the ability to tap into reach metrics that can only be attained by interacting with a global audience. For example, did you know that over 65 percent of YouTube subscribers recently stated in an online poll that they would take the advice of an online influencer over advice coming from a television-based personality? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A major role that influencer management agencies play is in helping celebrities, athletes, musicians, politicians, and other noteworthy individuals bridge that gap between old and new media. These agencies can easily turn a non-digitally based celebrity or personality into a powerhouse influencer. With over 75 percent of teenage YouTube subscribers stating that they relate to internet personalities more than off-line stars and celebrities, it is no wonder that so many of these prominent people or flooding into influencer agencies to modernize and monetize the way in which they interact with their fans and audience. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> The Key Stat That is Driving Influencer Based Marketing to New Heights </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The one key statistic that is driving influencer-based marketing to new heights, is the astonishing 75 million current internet users that employ ad-blocking technology on their smartphone, tablet, or pc. That figure is climbing by 5 percent or more each year. Ad blockers are powerful software programs that filter out traditional advertisements from being displayed in a web browser, app, or other media platform.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With influencers usually delivering their ads through interactive or opt-in content feeds, it is almost impossible for ad blockers to have any effect on this type of advertising as it isn't strictly code based nor easy to filter. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR NEXT WEBSITE REDESIGN</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-next-website-redesign</link>
<description>Do it for the Right Reasons. Just because the CEO doesn't like the look doesn't mean a website needs a redesign. Make sure the overhauling is for the right reasons, rather than just for the sake of redesign.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/pink+lady2.PNG"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Websites may need an overhaul, from time to time. But it's crucial to ensure you are truly in need of a redesigned website. Considering the stiff competition, companies make every effort to provide a refreshingly unique look to their websites. Before you step into the entire process of redesigning, you need to get ready really well for reaping the maximum benefits. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Given below are some of the most important tips that you can use to prepare yourself for an effective website redesign project. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Do it for the Right Reasons </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Just because the CEO doesn't like the look doesn't mean a website needs a redesign. Make sure the overhauling is for the right reasons, rather than just for the sake of redesign. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Define Business Goals </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't redesign a website just for the sake of redesigning it. Make sure you have some valid goals that you want to fulfil. The reasons for which you require an overhaul for your site should be put into written form or SWOT analysis. Unless you have some concrete goals to achieve, redesigning may not be a good idea. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Don't Depend on Guesswork </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> One of the biggest mistakes that most website owners make is that they guess things and start implementing them. Optimising a website for higher conversion is never going to be a guessing game. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't fire bullets in the dark hoping it would hit the target. Some of the best redesign practices that have worked well for others may not work for you. Do not blindly incorporate just any technique you may think of. Guessing things won't lead you anywhere. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Gather the Resources </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> After you have identified your goals, it is time to accumulate the resources you will need to get results. Well, your design department is quite proficient at creating visually appealing websites. However, that's not enough. You should involve SEO consultants, social media managers, and usability experts into the project as well. Likewise, you can think about other resources which you'll need to create a redesigned website which really delivers. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Protect Key Website Assets </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Many times, a website redesign has resulted in a drop in traffic and leads. Do you want the same happen to you? Don't make mistakes that will destroy the key assets of your website. Before you start the redesigning process, make sure you have taken an inventory of your website's assets, including content, inbound links, keyword rankings, conversion tools, etc. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> By following the above-mentioned steps, you'll make sure that you are geared up really well for giving your website a redesign. Focusing too much on the beauty of the design may deviate you from creating value-added content. The main focus of the entire process should always be on enhancing the user experience to increase conversions. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you need help with a website redesign, please get in touch with Your Digital Agency </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO IDENTIFY WEAKNESS & SET GOALS FOR YOUR BUSINESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-identify-weakness-set-goals-for-your-business</link>
<description>If your website and your social media are not achieving this, then you need to think about getting help. Your Digital Agency can help you make your website and social media accounts persuasive and enticing for potential clients.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1542103749-8ef59b94f47e.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> How to identify weaknesses and set realistic goals for your business </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It’s the start of a new year and a time for setting goals for the future of your business. The first thing to do is to decide what is the most important thing for your business to achieve this year It could be “to increase sales by 10%” or “get a number one ranking on Google”. This is the starting point for your goals, but you will need to refine them to the point where they are clear and achievable. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> The S.M.A.R.T. way of working out your goals. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The most commonly used tool when creating goals is the acronym, S.M.A.R.T., which means Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. Your goals must be specific, as just to say something like “increase sales”, for example, is too vague. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Your goals must be realistic </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don’t set goals that are totally unrealistic. If there’s no possibility of achieving it, like becoming the world’s number one online auction company, it defeats the purpose of setting the goal. Set goals that are achievable, but at the moment just out of reach, such as a “monthly turnover of $20,000” if your current turnover is $10,000. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Goals must be time-specific </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The goal must be relevant and including a time period can make the goal more motivational. For example, if we said “increase sales by 10% in 6 months”, this is a more specific time goal. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Now you have your goal, you need a plan to achieve it. Your goals should be divided into short, medium and long term and your plan should correspond to these time periods. So you should have a clear plan for the short term, for example, 3 months, medium-term maybe 6 months or a year and long term maybe 5 years or longer. If you are only setting goals for one year, you need to divide your plan into 12 months and set out your plan for each month. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Goals should be flexible </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Something to remember when doing this is that your plans and goals are not set in concrete as flexibility is important. You only have to look at 2020 to see how much goals and plans were frequently changed. It’s a good idea to have a checklist for your goals so you can cross them off a list when you have achieved them and create some new ones. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What next? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When considering your plan you also need to think about the weaknesses in your business which could upset those plans and which need to be fixed. These could include any number of things such as the checkout on your website, how easy or difficult it is for your customers to make a purchase or maybe a poorly written sales page. Are the finances of your business being drained by poor copywriting or maybe an unsightly or uninteresting website? It’s important that your customers understand what you stand for, how you can help them and what you want to achieve on their behalf. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If your website and your social media are not achieving this, then you need to think about getting help. Your Digital Agency  can help you make your website and social media accounts persuasive and enticing for potential clients. </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO BE THE LEADER IN YOUR CATEGORY</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-be-the-leader-in-your-category</link>
<description>In business, being 'one of the many' is the surest way to failure. Thanks to the Internet, we live in a borderless shopping world. Just looking at the sharp growth of eCommerce platforms like Amazon and eBay, its easy to conclude people are spoilt for choice.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1541844053589-346841d0b34c.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In business, being 'one of the many' is the surest way to failure. Thanks to the Internet, we live in a borderless shopping world. Just looking at the sharp growth of eCommerce platforms like Amazon and eBay, its easy to conclude people are spoilt for choice. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Differentiating a brand isn't difficult. However, being different for the sake of being different will not yield the desired result. It's shallow and will not stand the test of competition. To prevail and thrive, it's essential to ensure your reason-for-being not only sets you apart but resonates well with consumers. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In this post, we'll discuss the 5 steps to craft your differentiation. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 1. Clarify and define your unique value proposition </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> It's more than just being stronger or faster. In your brand's uniqueness, people must find it to be the best-fit solution for the problem they want to be resolved. Therefore, it's important to have a deep appreciation of their problem. It's the first step, ostensibly the most important, towards clarifying and defining your unique value proposition. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 2. What's your mission? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If your mission is to simplify online stock trading, make it evident to your target audience. In the process, outline the benefits of your solution. It's not uncommon for brands 'to shun and shy away' from overtly stating their mission. This happens when they're unclear of the problem they're solving. Use consumer research to pin down your target audience's problem. It may not be as obvious as you think it is. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 3. You're not the hero; your customers are </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Humility has a big part to play in crafting your brand story. Often, we like to think of the brand as the hero. Successful brands don't portray themselves as heroes. Rather, they focus on helping their target audience to be the hero. For example, with Squarespace, everyone can be a sought after web designer. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 4. Honesty </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The internet has produced countless 'faceless' brands. In the effort to sell fast and more, brands have taken to "Buy Now!" calls. Armed with seductive money-back guarantees or payment plans, they dig deep into your pockets for a quick sell. Hence, it's not surprising internet scams are rising. People are craving for honesty, authenticity and credibility. They are essential ingredients of emotional connections that build long-lasting and strong relationships. Make this a part of your brand value. When you do, you've added another layer to your unique value proposition. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 5. Over-deliver </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In the short-run, this may appear costly. But when you even it out over time, you'll realise it's the least expensive way of retaining customers and building loyalty. If you're able to deliver the items within 2 instead of the usual 3-5 days, do so. If you're able to provide 24/7 live support over a period of 5 days after the product or service has been delivered, do so. Communicating your commitment to customers is the premium customers are willing to pay for. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't be one of many. Be the only one.

<title>THANKING YOUR CUSTOMERS WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/thanking-your-customers-will-make-you-stand-out</link>
<description>When was the last time you genuinely said "Thank you" to your customers? If it was a while back, do it now. And when customers share them, expect the rippling effect to add to your brand standing.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1517076731070-13c65bcb2e86.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Can you recall the days when every sale was always followed up by a "Thank you"? You were probably in the early days of the business. Profitability or driving growth was probably far from your mind then. And customers reciprocated with "You're welcome" or "We'll be back". They were enough to keep you driven. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Mother Theresa once said, "Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless." That you are still in business, and perhaps growing stronger, can be attributed to a band of loyal customers who are the echoes reverberating from your "Thank you". Hopefully, you've not stopped expressing your gratitude consistently as the business grows. But if you have, this post is for you. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 1. Stand-out from the competition </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Generally, people dislike being taken for granted. Although they have a need for your product or service, they don't owe you anything. But people love to feel valued. Overtly demonstrating this is a point of differentiation businesses tend to overlook. Feeling valued is a dimension of emotional equity brands must have to stand out from the competition. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 2. Nurturing trust </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> At a time when mistrust - thanks to the pervasiveness of online scams - dominates the brand-customer relationship, nurturing trust is as critical as ensuring your product or service works. The good news is nurturing trust can start with expressing gratitude. After all, trust is two-way traffic. Each time customers make a purchase, they've demonstrated their trust in your product or service. Hence, it's only right you reciprocate with something as simple as "Thank you". </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 3. Social currency </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A great customer experience begs to be shared. Beyond being able to share their positive experience using your product or service, they've got something else to share with others - that you value their patronage. It becomes a talking point or social currency of your brand. All else held constant, it is this emotional equity that they can use to be advocates of your brand. Word-of-mouth is an extremely powerful sales technique, especially when it comes from customers. They are valued more than any other form of marketing communication. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 4. Customers will reward you </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When people feel appreciated and valued, it compels them to reciprocate accordingly. Everyone wants to feel good always. When you deliver this feel-good factor consistently, customers will keep coming back. Their loyalty is sowed. Above all, they will stand by you, especially during difficult times. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 5. You care enough to listen </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As mentioned above, expressing gratitude shows you appreciate and value customers. You do not take them for granted. To a large extent, you're also communicating to them you are listening. In the noisy and cluttered world of marketing communication, consumers are expected to be doing all the listening. On the contrary, the vice-versa is more important. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When was the last time you genuinely said "Thank you" to your customers? If it was a while back, do it now. And when customers share them, expect the rippling effect to add to your brand standing. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO DISCOVER THE WHY OF YOUR BUSINESS SUCCESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-discover-the-why-of-your-business-success</link>
<description>“You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don’t make money your goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off of you.” - Maya Angelou</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1592211951067-6c3ce19cca90.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> “You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don’t make money your goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off of you.” - Maya Angelou </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> By now, you'd have realised entrepreneurship isn't a bed of roses. You've probably wondered "why am I doing this?" countless times when faced with steep challenges. But the fact you're here now suggests you've overcome those moments. Have you ever wondered how you did it? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If Maya Angelou's quote resonates well with you, you've found the answer. You belong to a group of people with a deep appreciation of their "Why", which has brought them success in life. Their response to the question is the North Star directing them to success. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Steve Jobs was clear of his "Why", which is to change the way people think about personal computers. His love for all things beautiful, especially calligraphy, remains the foundation of Apple's success. At a time when computers were seen to be for the 'big guys', Apple found its way onto people's desks, bags, palms and now wrists. Why is knowing your "Why" critical? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 1. A significant point of differentiation </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> The late Tony Hsieh, the founder of Zappos, is credited for the excellent customer experience the company is known for. He strongly believes in looking after people first, both customers and employees. Ensuring their well-being is his "Why". Employees manning the call centre are known for engaging customers in conversations that may not necessarily lead to a sale. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Unlike other online retailers, Zappos did not treat technology as a point of differentiation. It's just an enabler. But being people-centric is. This "Why" is the company's reason for being. It sets them apart from competitors at a time when online shopping was changing the way people shop. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 2. Staying authentic is easier </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Authenticity is a brand characteristic businesses strive for. Unfortunately, an intensely competitive environment makes it challenging to live up to it. But with a clearly defined and stated "Why" staying authentic is easier even in the most challenging circumstances. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> 3. Effective decision-making </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> An organisation can't make decisions; it's the people in it. When owners and employees have a deep appreciation of the organisation's "Why", they'll marry it with information and insights to arrive at more effective decisions. After all, the best decisions are made within the context of a 'bigger' reason. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Are you looking to discover your "Why" or perhaps articulate it better? Here are some questions to guide you. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> 1. What gets you up in the morning? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> 2. What is the transformation you want to make in the lives of your target audience? What is the problem you want to solve for them? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> 3. What do you love doing even if you are not paid for it? </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When your target audience resonates with your "Why", it's easy to draw them towards you. They'll buy into what your brand stands for. It's your reason-for-being. Connect here to discover your "Why". </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO EVALUATE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN ONLINE MARKETING</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-evaluate-return-on-investment-in-online-advertising</link>
<description>What's my ROI (Return on Investment) for a Facebook or Instagram PPC (Pay Per Click) campaign?</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/gratisography-confident-smile.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Online advertising has become one of the most important components of a small business marketing plan. Online advertising is much more cost-effective than traditional media and gives you new ways to reach your audience. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> However, many businesses aren't getting the best return on investment (ROI) in their online advertising campaigns. To boost your success and improve your ROI for online advertising, you must first begin to track your ROI. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Define Goals for Online Advertising </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> To measure the success of your campaign, you must first set goals for your online advertising. The goals may vary depending on the type of medium you will pursue. </span> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Each of these goals gets you further contact with your clients or can translate directly to a sale, all of which has the potential to generate revenue. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Assign Monetary Value to Your Goals </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> How much are your goals worth? To track your ROI, you must assign a monetary value to your goals. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> For the most basic ROI equation, you can assign a value based on how often your goals result in sales, and what an average sale is worth to you. For example, if an average E-mail marketing campaign nets you 20 sales each worth $50, you make $1,000 in sales from that campaign. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As you track online advertising over time, you will get a sense of how much you can make and can better calculate your expenses and ROI. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> However, you can also go deeper and assign a value to click-throughs that don't result in immediate sales. Maybe you will find that future sales potential is higher among people who click-through your marketing E-mails. So probably a click-through that doesn't result in an immediate conversion is worth $3 in the long term. Say you get an extra 60 click-throughs that don't result in an immediate conversion, but you know they are worth $3 each, so you have netted an additional $180 in revenue on top of direct sales. From that $1,180 in gross revenue, you can subtract your expenses and find your net profit from the E-mail campaign. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Formulas to Determine ROI in Online Advertising </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You can use many formulas to calculate your ROI in online advertising depending on how detailed you want to get. Two of the most common formulas are: </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> ROI Gross Profit Percentage: </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> This formula calculates the ROI on a transactional basis. To track your ROI as a gross profit percentage, calculate: (Return - Marketing Investment) / Marketing Investment. With this calculation, you can tweak your online marketing campaigns as needed and track the ROI to find out what performs best, and ultimately boost your ROI. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> ROI Based on Lifetime Value: </span> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> You can also calculate your ROI for online advertising based on the lifetime value of your customer. If you often have repeat sales from customers that you have gained once, you can calculate the lifetime ROI using this formula: (Customer Lifetime Value - Marketing Investment) / Marketing Investment. </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Ultimately, tracking your ROI for online advertising is a vital component of measuring the success of your marketing campaign. If you are getting a poor ROI, you can discontinue a certain element of your marketing campaign and allocate those funds toward a better-performing segment. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Alternately, you can tweak your campaign to boost your ROI. Assign goals and values to your online marketing campaign in order to accurately track your ROI. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What's the expected ROI on your Paid Ads? </span> </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Running successful paid advertising campaigns means tracking and understanding your metrics. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO MANAGE YOUR BUSINESS'S ONLINE REPUTATION</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-manage-your-business-s-online-reputation</link>
<description>What's Online Reputation? The online reputation of a business is actually what its customers have to say about its product or services. The views of customers and clients can have a major impact on your business. A good online reputation is vital for driving better outcomes and protecting the livelihood.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1548778052-311f4bc2b502.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Today, a lot of business owners are worried about managing their online reputation. Also known as Internet reputation management (IRM) or online reputation management (ORM).  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> This is a fantastic digital marketing strategy businesses owners can use to maintain a clean image of their people, product, or services. It's definitely the reputation of a business which matters the most. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What's Online Reputation? </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The online reputation of a business is actually what its customers  have to say about its product or services. The views of customers and clients can have a major impact on your business. A good online reputation is vital for driving better outcomes and protecting the livelihood. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Whether you are selling a product, advertising service, or promoting a brand, the chances are that interested people are going to have a look at the online reputation of your business. These people can be consumers, stakeholders, marketers, clients, or business partners. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you want to drive greater demand for your product or services and attract more customers, managing your business reputation on the social web is extremely important. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Results of Negative Online Reputation </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Negative online reputation of a business can have a wide range of impacts. It can affect the credibility of your brand. It can affect your share price. It can affect your sells. It can even lead to a boycott of your products across the entire industry. Not only big industry players but even small businesses can become a victim of a negative reputation on the social web. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> As you continue to grow your business, you need to keep a close watch on how you are building the reputation of your business. If searches for your name or company don't bring relevant results (i.e., results are not about you), you should quickly start to focus on building a good reputation online.  </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The actual problem arises when searching for your product, services, or company fetches negative feedback, complaints, or comments. If a customer or a visitor to your website lodges a complaint with a consumer complaints website, it's going to create potential problems for you. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Negative search results may include fake information, negative comments, bad news, competitor attacks, consumer complaints sites, etc. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Managing the Reputation of Your Business </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If your business has an online presence, you can never stop people from discussing your products or services. You'll face both positive as well as negative feedback from consumers. Since online conversations can have a considerable impact on the growth of your business, it's important to make sure you do some planning in advance and develop a strategy to protect your livelihood. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Start Off with Listening to Your Customers </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you want to manage your brand's online reputation, you should start by listening to what your consumers or customers have to say. Active and careful listening makes you aware of the requirements of customers, what they like, and what they don't. Whether customers love your product (or services) or hate it, they'll share their feedback on one social platform or another. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Listening will help you know the following: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In a nutshell, listening prepares a business for interacting with customers. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Interact </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> By now, you must have known how you should interact or participate in the conversation with your customers. The real power of Online Reputation Management (ORM) lies in 'interaction with customers.' By joining the conversation, you can not only immediately respond to negative commenting, but you can also benefit from opportunities that can drive sales. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> While dealing with a negative reputation, businesses need to be very careful. If you show an exaggerated response, you can immediately lose the credibility of your business. It's important to understand that even negative comments can sometimes bring you opportunities for driving more engagement among consumers. So, tread this ground with care and wisdom. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> While handling negative comments, try to focus on the following: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Use Online Reputation Management Tools to Fine-tune Social Strategy </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are multiple ORM tools that business can use to keep track of what's being said about their products and services. By analysing the buzz carefully, you can also keep an eye on your competitors' activities. As a result, you can fine-tune your social media strategy more to drive business growth. Google Alerts is a popular tool that you can use to track and analyse the buzz. </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Start building your online reputation before it's too late. Use the above-mentioned tips to develop a well-planned strategy for managing your brand's credibility on the social web. </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>TOP 6 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD OUTSOURCE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR YOUR MEDSPA</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/top-6-reasons-why-you-should-outsource-social-media-for-your-medspa</link>
<description>No matter the size of your medical spa business, you cannot afford to neglect your social media marketing strategy.</description>
<content:encoded><div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1531853121101-cb94c8ed218d.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Being successful on social media means hours of hard work. Time is just one reason you should outsource a social media manager. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span> ﻿ </span> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> No matter the size of your medical spa business, you cannot afford to neglect your social media marketing strategy. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Not only is the majority of the population of the world now on social media, but people who see products and services on social media are  </span> <a href="https://www.socialmedianews.com.au/social-media-statistics-australia-january-2020/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> significantly more likely </a> <span style="display: initial;">  to remember that product than if they saw it on general web browsing. This is especially true when it comes to spa products and services. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You might be thinking that you can be your own social media manager and simply take care of it yourself. However, this might not be the best path to success. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you outsource social media marketing, you will be putting the most important arm of your marketing into the hands of seasoned professionals. Here are six reasons to consider outsourcing social media today.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 1. A Social Media Manager Builds Networks  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Before learning how to hire a social media manager for your medical spa, it is worth knowing just what is so important about the job they do. One of the things they do that requires true expertise is network building. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> This means getting your business social media accounts amplified by major companies and influencers. It means connecting your brand  </span> <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com.au/australian-influencers-instagram" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> with influencers </a> <span style="display: initial;">  for campaigns. It means plugging your brand into what is happening in your industry.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 2. Social Media is a 24/7 Job  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you are trying to run a medical spa, it is unlikely that you will be able to react to real-time events in a way that is essential for social media success. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> One missed moment can mean seriously missed opportunities for your business. Social media never sleeps, so hire a manager who will be on top of things 24/7.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 3. Outsource Social Media to Save Money  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> You might think that outsourcing social media duties will actually be a major expense. However, doing so is likely to save you money and resources in the long run. A social media manager will take the time-intensive work of boosting your brand out of your hands. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> This allows you and your team to focus on what matters - growing your business. In addition, the potential sales boost from a successful social media campaign could dwarf whatever you end up paying to outsource social media.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 4. Social Media Tells a Story About Your Medical Spa  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A key part of the social media job description is to tell a compelling story that gets people's attention and builds your  </span> <a href="https://kickandco.com.au/5-branding-basics/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> brand's identity </a> <span style="display: initial;"> . </span> </p> <p> It means putting together cohesive campaigns and redesigning your online presence so that you are instantly recognizable to your customers.

<description>Your online marketing efforts won't bring results until you know who your ideal or target customer is.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;" data-rss-type="text"> <h3> <span style="display: initial;"> Your online marketing efforts won't bring results until you know who your ideal or target customer is </span> </h3> </div> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/your+digital+agency+digital+marketing-2800x1867.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are so many online marketing strategies, but do you know how to choose the best ones for your specific business requirements? On the one hand, you can never ignore the potential of promoting your business online. On the other, you need to use the right kind of online marketing tactics so that you can reach out to the right type of audience without wasting time and money. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Given below are a couple of very essential tips (questions) that you can use (ask) to choose the right marketing strategy for your business. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> Who is Your Ideal Customer? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Your online marketing efforts won't bring results until you know who your ideal or target customer is. The process of identifying the ideal customer is target customer profiling. Once you're aware of the demographics, psycho-graphics, and behavioural attributes of your target customer, you'll be in a better position to move your marketing efforts in the right direction. Therefore, know more about your existing customers and talk to them so that you can identify what an ideal customer for your business looks like. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The purpose of reviewing your current customer base should be to recognise those that bring you maximum profits. Most of the small businesses or companies make the mistake of looking at their biggest clients as their target customers. The idea is to list your customers in terms of profitability first. Once you're done with it, you can then categorise them on the basis of industry, size and other demographics. And always remember to stick with the target customer profile. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What are Your Business Goals? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are different online marketing tools to fulfil different business goals. Find out what goals you want to achieve. Do you want to expand the reach of your business? Do you want to retain your existing customers? Do you want to build an online community of loyal followers? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Where Do Your Customers Hang Out? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> In order to reach out to the right kind of customers at the right time, you need to find out where your target audience hangs out. There are multiple online and social media platforms. But your target audience doesn't spend time on all of them. When you know where your potential customers spend most of their time, you'll be able to focus on the right channels. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What Metrics Do You Need to Focus On? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Effective online marketing is also about concentrating on the right metrics. To become a 'power user' of online marketing tools, you should be able to focus on the right metrics. Internet marketing requires both time, patience and money. If you are unable to track or measure your progress, your investments might just be wasted. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you choose the wrong metrics, you can easily burn your fingers and frustrate yourself. At the same time, you need to limit the number of metrics so that you don't suffer from information overload. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> What's Your Budget? </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Monetary investment can make a huge difference to online marketing. It's how much you plan to spend that decides what strategies you should use for to grow your online business. If you have a strict budget, you may choose cheaper or low-cost options. If you want to hire professionals for the best use of online marketing tools, you will need a higher budget. Decide how much you're actually willing to invest. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are a lot of small businesses that are unaware of what online marketing strategies fit in with their business needs. They get confused! Thanks to this checklist, you will take your marketing to the next level. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> Recommended Reading from our friends at Albacross - </span> </span> <a href="https://albacross.com/newsroom/ideal-customer-profile/" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> An article "The Guide to Creating A Killer Ideal Customer Profile" </a> </p> </div></content:encoded>

More Brand Awareness </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> A brand is a story you tell your customers. The story that a customer feels when they make a purchase from your business. When it comes to the medical industry, you need to promote your brand. It could be about how to make people feel healthy or the benefits of seeing a doctor.  <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> The goal is to promote your brand on social media.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 2. Be Consistent </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Another trick when it comes to social media is to be consistent. Be consistent with what you post during the week and take  </span> <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/297259" target="_blank" style="display: initial;"> advantage of certain times </a> <span style="display: initial;">  to post on social media. The more consistent you are, the more followers you can attract with relevant information.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 3. Talk About Misinformation </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When you are posting on social media, you should talk about misinformation. You should talk about misinformation in the health industry.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> With a lot of false information floating around social media and the internet, it's important to show people facts and the truth about the medical industry.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 4. Talk About the Research </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Part of talking about misinformation is talking about the research. You should take a deep dive into the statistics and health journals that talk about something specific. It can help you build trust with your followers.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 5. Build Your Email List </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Another trick to consider with social media is to make sure you are building your email list. You can create ads on social media that offer users information in exchange for their email address. This helps you stay connected with your followers.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 6. Engage With Your Followers </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Don't forget to engage with your followers on social media by giving them a shoutout or navigating the conversation. You especially want to make sure you monitor the conversation on your post, particularly if it's a post that is more controversial.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> 7. Try Advertising </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Lastly, you should consider advertising on social media. This can help you reach a wider audience. You can also try different social media campaigns that are centered on brand awareness, lead generation, conversion, or another kind of campaign.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; display: initial;"> Now You Know About the Best Tricks to Running Social Media for Businesses </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> These tricks to running social media for businesses, especially medical businesses, can help you reach your target market and connect with them.  These tricks can also help you build an online presence which makes people more aware of your business and helps you show knowledge of your industry.  </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;"> If you want help with your online presence, </span> </span> <a href="/contact" style="display: initial;"> you can contact us here. </a> <span style="display: initial;"> <span style="display: initial;">   </span> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/8-seo-tips-for-online-e-commerce-store-owners</link>
<description>If you need help with the SEO of your online store, please contact Your Digital Agency, and we can work with any type of platforms, such as Shopify, WordPress, Duda, Wix, Squarespace and even Weebly.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Optimise your online store for better visibility in search engines like Google &amp; Bing </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1556514767-5c270b96a005.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Many online store owners heavily rely on PPC (Pay Per Click) programs for advertising their online store while completely ignoring the SEO part. However, they should have paid careful attention to optimising their online stores for organic search rankings as well. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> There are many ways you can optimise your online store for better visibility in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. The extent of your e-commerce store's SEO also depends on the kind of features your e-commerce service provider offers if you are working with platforms like Wordpress, Shopify, Volusion, Big Commerce, Spiffy Stores or Goodsie among others. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Given below are eight important tips that every online e-commerce store owner should abide by to achieve higher organic search rankings. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3> <span style="display: initial;"> On-Page Optimisation </span> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Have an On-Site Blog </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Google loves to see fresh content on your site. Attaching a blog to your online store is a surefire way of adding that fresh content. It's best if you could install a WordPress blog on your online store (Google adores WordPress). Otherwise, you can also use the self-hosted blog of your e-commerce website builder. Once you have set up the blog, you should consistently publish articles on the same. In any case, you need to make sure you cover relevant topics and that your blog posts are keyword-optimised. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Say 'No' to Duplicate Product Descriptions </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Copy-pasting product description from the manufacturer's site to your site is the worst thing you can ever do, as far as the SEO of your online store is concerned. No matter what type of products you are selling on your online store, make sure you write fresh descriptions to avoid search engine penalty. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Don't Use Same Meta Tags for All Pages </span> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Every web page of your store should have unique metadata. Many website builders provide you with the option of adding your own custom meta info to the homepage as well as each of your product pages. If every single page of your online store carries the same metadata, you are making a huge mistake as far as search engine optimization of your site is concerned. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Optimise Product Images </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Since it's an online store, you'll definitely need to place images of the products that you want to sell. Having short but descriptive alt tags for the product images you use can quickly give you an extra edge in terms of SEO. Don't forget that a good number of people who want to buy a specific product or item use the image search feature. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Set Up a Clean URL Structure </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> When you want to improve the SEO of your online e-commerce store, you should also pay careful attention to the URL structure. While working with a third-party e-commerce website builder, you should make sure it offers you full control over the structure of your web page URLs. Short, keyword-rich URLs will enhance your site's SEO. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Pay Careful Attention to Internal Linking </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Internal linking is an important part of the SEO process as it allows visitors to find relevant content on your site. On an individual product page, you should never forget to include links to other related products that your store features. While linking internally, it's a good idea to add keywords, but don't overdo it. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <h3> <span style="display: initial;"> Off-Page Optimisation </span> </h3> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Build Quality Backlinks </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Apart from featuring great and keyword-optimised content on your online store, you also need to gather lots of high-quality backlinks. Google scans a site's backlink profile to gauge its overall authority on the web. Therefore, you should never forget to have a white-hat link building strategy in place. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> To build backlinks, you should do the following: </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> Most importantly, you'll need to feature top quality content on your site on a regular basis. Otherwise, nobody would want to link to it. In any case, you should never engage in any type of link schemes. Many online store owners are so desperate that they want to build hundreds of backlinks overnight. Beware! It can lead your site to serious search engine penalties. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Go Social </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> SEO of an online store also includes participating in social media platforms. Make sure your business has a presence on popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, among others. By actively participating at these social platforms, you'll be able to create social influence, thereby benefiting your SEO. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> SEO is vital to your online store's success because it increases the visibility of your business in search engines. As you obtain higher search rankings, you start to drive more traffic and potential customers to your store. This guide will help you to increase the likelihood of appearing at the top of search engines. </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> <br/> </span> </p> <p> <span style="display: initial;"> If you need help with the SEO of your online store, please contact Your Digital Agency, and we can work with any type of platfoms, such as Shopify, Wordpress, Duda, Wix, Squarespace and even Weebly.  </span> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>SOCIAL MARKETING TRENDS TO TRY</title>

<description>The average person spends approximately two hours a day on social media sites. Not only do they browse and read posts from friends, but they also interact with brands from all over the globe.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Here are 3 tips to implement on social media channels </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/young-business-woman-at-office-PUEB4PK.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Try the latest social media marketing trends to gain new followers and grow your audience and brand. Here are 3 tips to implement on social media channels. <div> <br/> <div> The average person spends approximately two hours a day on social media sites. Not only do they browse and read posts from friends, but they also interact with brands from all over the globe. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> There’s no question that social media offers an exceptionally effective way to build brand awareness, generate new traffic, and more. However, this is only possible if the right strategy and tactics are used. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Just like anything else in the marketing world, what works on social media is constantly evolving. Remaining aware of the latest social media marketing trends is challenging, but the information here is designed to give all business owners a heads up regarding what works today. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> The Rise of Private Groups </b> </div> <div> <b> <br/> </b> </div> <div> In 2018 Facebook launched “Facebook Groups.” This allowed users to participate as a business page, update with Stories, post Live videos in the group, and create social learning units. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The goal of Groups was to help brands connected directly with their fans without the algorithm impacting the posts made. This helps garner fast feedback about services and products but also serves as a useful engagement tool. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Due to the effectiveness of Facebook Groups, Instagram users are following suit, creating private Instagram accounts to avoid the limiting algorithm. Private alternative accounts are also being created to increase interest in a specific brand. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Video, Video, Video! </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> In real estate, it’s “location, location, location!” In social media marketing, it’s “video, video, video!”  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> While the video isn’t a new trend, it’s one that’s more effective today than ever before. As a result, it’s something all brands – regardless of size or industry – should be using. </span> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Some best practices for creating a video for social media sharing include: </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <ol> <li> Create goals for the video </li> <li> Create a video that’s 30 to 60 seconds </li> <li> For Stories, use 15-second micro-segment of the longer videos created </li> <li> Repurpose content when possible </li> <li> Make it engaging within the first 10 seconds </li> </ol> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> By using the best practices here, videos are going to have the most impact possible. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Transparency is Key </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Everyone wants to know how companies are using their data.

<description>Taking your marketing strategy to the next level likely involves getting expert help. Here's how to find the best digital marketing agency for your needs.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Taking your marketing strategy to the next level likely involves getting expert help </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/office-worker-PEHAKVJ.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Taking your marketing strategy to the next level likely involves getting expert help. Here's how to find the best digital marketing agency for your needs. <div> <br/> <div> Businesses in Australia spend about $17 billion a year on marketing and advertising. Modern business owners understand that having an online presence is essential when trying to expand their client base. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Trying to develop and implement new marketing campaigns on your own, hiring professionals is a much better idea. Not only can a digital marketing agency help you achieve goals, they can also take a lot of stress off of your plate. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> With all of the different companies on the market, choosing the best digital marketing agency will require lots of research. Here are some of the things you should consider before choosing a digital marketing agency to hire. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Checking Their Industry-Specific Experience </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Narrowing down the list of marketing agencies at your disposal is no easy task. One of the main things you should consider before hiring a marketing agency is the industry-specific experience they have. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> As any business owner knows, success in the online world is no easy task. An agency with industry-specific experience will know how to find and engage your audience. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Asking for a portfolio of previous work is essential when trying to make this important decision. By seeing how well an agency has performed for others in the past, you can decide whether or not they are the best fit. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Full Transparency is Vital </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you are like most business owners, your schedule is quite full. The busier you get, the harder it will be to stay involved in all of the marketing campaigns being implemented by professionals. This is why working with an agency that will provide in-depth progress reports on a regular basis is vital. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> With these progress reports, you can see where your marketing dollars are being spent and how successful each campaign is. Knowing when to abandon a particular marketing method is essential when trying to avoid wasting resources. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You need to realize that the buck stops with you when it comes to marketing campaigns. If you don’t feel like you are getting a return on your investment, you shouldn’t hesitate to pull the plug on a particular campaign. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> The Best Digital Marketing Agency Will Be Trustworthy </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Feeling comfortable about paying dollars to a marketing company is only possible if you trust them. Looking for social proof of a marketing agency’s good reputation is crucial. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Most marketing agencies will have positive customer reviews posted on the homepage of their website. Doing a bit of independent research is also a great way to find reviews about a particular agency. While this in-depth research will be time-consuming, it is definitely worth the effort invested. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Take Your Time </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> When attempting to find the best digital marketing agency, avoid getting impatient. Ignoring the need for research may lead to you hiring the wrong agency. </div> <div> <br/> </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW TO BUILD A STRONG BRAND IDENTITY</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-to-build-a-strong-brand-identity</link>
<description>Are you curious about how to build a strong brand identity for your business? If so, check out the helpful tips below.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Spend some time learning how to build your brand. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/gratisography-wild-cosmic-man.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Building a strong brand identity will help you attract and retain more clients in the long run. Spend some time learning how to build your brand. <div> <br/> <div> Something as simple as the use of a unique colour in your company’s logo can improve brand recognition by up to 80 per cent. Finding a way to set your business apart from the competition is imperative when trying to have long-term success. One of the main ways you can accomplish this is by creating a unique and engaging brand identity. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> High levels of brand awareness will allow you to cultivate high levels of recognition for the products and services your company offers. This level of recognition will lead to higher sales and a larger customer base. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Are you curious about how to build a strong brand identity for your business? If so, check out the helpful tips below. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Hone in on What Makes Your Company Different </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Dealing with competition is something all business owners have to do. As you start to develop a brand identity for your company, you need to figure out what sets you apart from your competition. Finding that one unique thing that is all yours can help you garner attention from consumers. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The only way to identify what makes your company special is by doing extensive research of your competition. Once you know how these companies are structured and what they offer, it will be much easier to create your original brand identity based on subtle differences. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Be Consistent With Your Brand </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The main thing you have to do to win a consumer over is to establish trust. Most consumers will do extensive research online to see how consistent your brand is on multiple channels. If your messaging on your website is different than the content on social media, it may cost you a potential sales lead. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Educating your team on what your company message is and what values you have is vital. By putting your company’s mission and image in writing, you can avoid issues with brand inconsistency. If you are outsourcing digital or social media marketing tasks, you need to make sure this company knows the ins and outs of your brand. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Never Let Your Brand Identity Become Negative </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> When people think about your brand, you want positivity and consistency to come to mind. This is why you need to avoid being negative in any facet of your branding or marketing strategy. Instead of poor-mouthing the competition, simply point out the differences between what you offer and what they offer. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If a consumer gets the idea you are basing your branding on negativity, they will probably head for the hills. This will only lead to your competition getting more leads, which is the exact opposite of what your branding should do. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Getting Professional Help When Creating a Brand Identity is a Must </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you are unfamiliar with how to create a brand identity, then hiring professionals to help out is crucial. With their help, you can avoid making branding mistakes. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Are you trying to create more leads with your brand?  </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>SIMPLE STRATEGIES TO BOOST SEO</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/9-simple-strategies-to-boost-seo</link>
<description>Boost your SEO and improve Google rankings with these 3 simple strategies. We help you understand how to improve SEO and grow your audience quickly.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Boost your SEO and improve Google rankings with these 3 simple strategies. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1554774853-d50f9c681ae2.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> We help you understand how to improve SEO and grow your audience quickly. <div> <br/> <div> Did you realise that a consistent online brand presentation can increase revenue by up to 23 per cent? Modern consumers use the Internet to research a company before using them. The only way to increase the number of leads your website produces is by focusing on search engine optimisation. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Some business owners think that simply publishing a website is all they need to do to get quality leads. In reality, a lot of hard work goes into getting a website on the first page of popular search engines like Google. Learning how to improve SEO can help you grow your customer base substantially. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Read on to find out how to boost your website’s search engine rank in a simple and effective way. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Consistently Publish Quality Content </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Most consumers have an insatiable appetite for knowledge. This hunger for knowledge can only be satisfied with relevant and engaging content. Focusing on developing content that is both easy to read and filled with useful information is vital when trying to edge out the competition. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Before developing content, you need to figure out who your audience is and what information they are looking for. Each of the posts you draft and publish needs to feature popular keyword phrases. If you are unsure about how to find these keywords, working with a marketing professional is crucial. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Focus on Your Metadata </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Creating an appealing website should be priority number one for a business owner trying to create an online presence. During the website design phase, you will probably notice that each page you publish will have a spot for metadata. This metadata should be reflective of the content on the page in question. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The title metadata is generally displayed at the top of the browser window. Ideally, you want this metadata to include the primary keyword you are targeting. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You will also need to fill out the description metadata for each page. This metadata needs to be a short description of the subject matter being covered. By incorporating your primary keyword into all of your metadata, you can draw the attention of search engine bots with ease. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Don’t Forget to Create a Linking Strategy </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> When drafting blogs for your website, it is important to provide the reader with as much context as possible. The best way to achieve this is by inserting both internal and external links in the text. These links will need to be put into words that are relevant to the subject matter on the page. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you are linking to other sites, you need to make sure they are reputable. Linking to sites that are considered spam may lead to your website being penalized, which will lower your search engine ranking. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Trying to Figure Out How To Improve SEO? </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you are in the process of trying to figure out how to improve SEO, then consulting with professionals in the digital marketing industry is vital. Professionals can provide you with a plethora of information that can help you generate more leads from your website. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Looking for help on how to drive traffic to your website? If so, get in touch! </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>ADVANTAGES THAT SOCIAL MEDIA BRINGS FOR YOUR BUSINESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/5-advantages-that-social-media-brings-for-your-business</link>
<description>In the absence of digital marketing, your inbound traffic will be limited to your existing network or contacts. By utilising social media, you’ll have more chances of reaching more people outside your current circle.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> By utilising social media, you’ll have more chances of reaching more people outside your circle. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/free+social+media+audit-3510x1467.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Social networks are an essential part of every marketing strategy, and the benefits are so great that anyone not utilising this cost-effective resource is missing out on a phenomenal opportunity. <div> <br/> <div> However, many marketing professionals are unsure of the tactics needed to be effective. A few key advantages that social media brings to the table are mentioned below. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Brand Recognition </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> One most cost-efficient digital marketing methods is the use of syndicated content that can significantly increase your brand recognition helping you engage with a broad range of consumers. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> To begin with, create social media profiles for your businesses and get employees, business partners, and clients to “like” and “share” your page. Having these people connected to your brand can increase your business profile and help build your reputation. Content that is shared with them will then be introduced to a new audience of individuals, leading them to be aware of your business and eventually customers in the future. </div> <div> <b> <br/> </b> </div> <div> <b> Improved Rankings </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Search engine optimisation is crucial in achieving higher page rankings and driving traffic to your business website. Being able to rank high for your keywords will generate positive results for your business. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> While social media cannot directly improve search engine rankings, it can give you more opportunities to be visible to industry influencers who may write favorably of your business and provide links back – resulting in higher search engine rankings. To place yourself well, create high-quality content that integrates your targeted keywords. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Inbound Traffic </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> In the absence of digital marketing, your inbound traffic will be limited to your existing network or contacts. By utilising social media, you’ll have more chances of reaching more people outside your current circle. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Think of every social media profile you have as a gateway to your website, and every piece of content as yet another opportunity to acquire a new customer. Populating your content on as many social networks as possible allows prospects to organically discover and reach your business. Through such marketing tactics you are effectively opening up your business to a wider range of versatile global consumers. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Higher Conversion </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> People prefer to do business with other individuals, rather than faceless entities. Social media marketing allows a positive impression for your business by giving it a human aspect. When brands interact through sharing of content, commenting, etc. on social media, it results in personification. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> People use social media to stay connected to their friends, family, and communities. Consumers who follow your social accounts will often trust the credibility of your business. The bigger the impression, the more likely they are to remember you when the need for a product or service arises. By throwing your brand into the mix, a business with social characteristics stands to benefit. </div> <div> <b> <br/> </b> </div> <div> <b> Better Customer Satisfaction </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> With social media as a voice for your company, networking and communication with your customers will benefit. Customers appreciate it when they receive a personalised response when they post comments on your pages. You need to be able to acknowledge and respond to your visitors’ needs to provide them the best experience. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Whether it’s a question or a complaint, social platforms allow you to address the matter using interpersonal dialogue. A brand devoted to customer satisfaction will inherently be viewed in a positive light. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> NEED HELP WITH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA?

<title>DISCOVER TARGET AUDIENCES WITH THESE MARKETING STRATEGIES FROM GARTNER RESEARCH</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/discover-target-audiences-with-these-three-marketing-strategies-from-gartner-research</link>
<description>The Gartner Marketing Symposium/Xpo 2019 in San Diego had experts talking about the increasing number of challenges marketers face these days as a result of the audience and media segmentation, as well as fast-evolving consumer behaviours across different platforms.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Increasing number of challenges marketers face  </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1524293568345-75d62c3664f7.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> The Gartner Marketing Symposium/Xpo 2019 in San Diego had experts talking about the increasing number of challenges marketers face these days as a result of audience and media segmentation, as well as fast-evolving consumer behaviours across different platforms. <div> <br/> <div> Marketers are coping with the potential loss of target audiences because more and more people tend to buy through ads incorporated in their Netflix and Amazon Prime Video subscriptions. Then there's also the rising media prices and increasing number of competitors to deal with. To manage these growing challenges, Gartner, Inc. has offered the following three tactics to assist marketers in their identification and engagement with their target audiences. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Know the Nature of Your Audience </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Defining your target audience with care does not stop at addressing the "who" part. Consider keeping in mind that responding to the "how," "when," and "where" is just as important. Try to keep a handle on the big picture, even if that is becoming increasingly hard to do with the digital clutter generated by the era of big data. Knowing the nature of your target audience more or less means embracing inclusiveness. Think, for example, in terms of how multiple audience segments can translate to higher number of views. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Don't lose track of the different ways with which your advertising campaigns can reach target audiences. You have your first-party data. You also have third-party data gathered from media panel sources, social media platforms, compiled files, as well as the tech tools at your disposal when you launch digital ads. While planning how and where to engage with the various audience segments you have, keep in mind these important factors for multimedia activation--privacy, portability, persistence of marketing messaging, scale of advertising campaign, and precision. </div> <div> <b> <br/> </b> </div> <div> <b> Branch Out and Harmonise Your Multimedia Marketing Plan </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Your digital media plan must be well coordinated in terms of projected reach and frequency of ad deployments, otherwise you are simply wasting your limited marketing budget. After identifying your target audience, go through your media plan line by line. Pay attention to the areas where quick changes in consumer behaviour are normally reported, so you can adjust accordingly. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> One example of a fast-changing dynamic is the TV viewing behaviour of consumers. The big-budget line items in your marketing plan, as well as the possible overlaps in the media used by your target audience, must also be carefully taken into account and scrutinised constantly. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Make Measurement Errors Part of Your Marketing Plan </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You are going to make miscalculations and targeting misses, even with advanced analytics and inclusive audience segmentation. This means you need to make allowances for imperfect measurements right onto your marketing plan. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> All in all, leverage resources you currently have, such as the in-built tech tools for your ads. Focus on key indicators, such as cost-per-incremental reach point. Because fluctuations in audience needs, demands, and preferences across media platforms are always going to affect even the most thoughtfully constructed marketing campaign. </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<description>Social media offers many opportunities to marketers and brands, and any business that wants to succeed needs to incorporate it into its marketing strategy.</description>

<title>CALCULATING CONTENT MARKETING ROI: A DEEP DIVE INTO CONTENT PERFORMANCE</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/calculating-content-marketing-roi-a-deep-dive-into-content-performance</link>
<description>The thing to remember about content marketing is that you get out of it whatever you put in. Your investment of time, attention, and effort are directly proportional to your eventual success. If you come away with just one piece of advice, make it this one: Your goal should be to produce content that exudes passion and creativity in equal measure.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Content marketing is as vital for the small business as it is potentially confusing.  </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/content+is+king+your+digital+agency-3000x3000.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Content marketing is as vital for the small business as it is potentially confusing. With such a wealth of content types to choose from, deciding on a plan of attack can feel like a full-time job and in many cases, it is. <div> <br/> <div> According to data furnished by Content Marketing Institute, 88 percent of organisations engage in some kind of content marketing. That's a pretty compelling call to action, but it also tells us something else: The market is saturated. So the question is which kinds of content are worth your time? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Here is an overview of potential answers to that question by breaking down the major content types and what they have to offer. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Blog Posts </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Blog posts have been around pretty much as long as the internet. But don't let that fool you; blog posts are a venerable content marketing technique and still have a lot to offer the emerging business. If your company doesn't have a blog yet, it's time to build one. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Already have a blog? Excellent. Your next goal is deciding what you want your blog to accomplish. Because blog posts occupy the top layer of the content marketing funnel, they're designed first and foremost to drive traffic and build brand awareness. For small businesses that occupy either a very specific niche or an overcrowded market, blogs are particularly important. You're up against an array of other companies competing for a limited amount of business, so your first impression is everything. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> For an example of this, take a look at the blog of Quincy Compressor, who have turned their blog into a knowledge resource. The appearance (or lack thereof) of both knowledgeability and candor can make or break a business like this one, and a blog goes a long way toward creating that impression. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Now, a point of caution: It can be tempting to get mired in so-called "vanity metrics." Moz suggests that for smaller websites, 30 individual sessions in a day could be as much as 70 percent spam referral. Not good! </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> So to combat some of that false hope, turn instead to more meaningful metrics, such as bounce rate and returning visitors. When the average web visitor stays on a particular page an average of just 15 seconds, you want to know who's sticking around and who's coming back on subsequent days. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Infographics </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Most of the content is text-based, which makes infographics stand out in a big way. Because of their highly viral and visual nature, infographics can be a huge linkable asset for companies. Companies that publish infographics enjoy an average of about 12 percent more growth than those that do not. But turning a piece of visual content into a resource that generates clicks and links all on its own is really difficult. So what's to be done? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> First, return to the idea of storytelling. It's really easy to build an infographic that has facts, figures, and pie charts. But that's not compelling in and of itself. Your job is to build a story around that data. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> But perhaps more than any of the other content here, infographics also require a considerable amount of follow-through. You're going to want to build a scalable and repeatable workflow for pitching your infographic to journalists who walk the same beats you do. Keep track of these new contacts in a spreadsheet and remember to follow up after a polite interval. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> White Papers </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You can think of white papers as adult-sized research papers, not unlike what you might've written back in your school years. White papers take a complex subject and present it in a well-researched, well-organised document. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> To put it simply, white papers are a gamble. They take more time, effort and know-how than blog posts, but the tradeoff is that they can allow you to reach a more specific audience, and they have the potential to generate more meaningful leads than a one-size-fits-all blog post. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> So the question is how much time you're willing to invest. According to Scoop, it's a breakdown, producing just three white papers translates into a total cost of 360 hours, whereas with just 124 additional hours, you could produce about 120 blog posts instead. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you're interested in getting started with white papers, here's some advice: Don't be afraid to pillage your existing body of work. You can repurpose older, evergreen blog posts and expand them into more comprehensive studies, for example. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Ebooks </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Finally, take a look at ebooks. Think of them like a grown-up version of the white paper. Something that sets ebooks apart from short-form content like blog posts is that they're typically located behind either a paywall or some other kind of gate. Even if you don't want to ask for money, you can request contact information, or a follow on social media. As a result, ebooks can be a great way to measure serious interest in your product. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> It should be said that ebooks are among the costliest types of content to produce, second only, perhaps, to the infographic. But, like white papers, if you already have a company blog, you already have a wealth of inspiration to draw on to build your first ebook. And as a way of educating your prospective customers about your product or service, ebooks are second to none. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Conclusion </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The thing to remember about content marketing is that you get out of it whatever you put in. Your investment of time, attention, and effort are directly proportional to your eventual success. If you come away with just one piece of advice, make it this one: Your goal should be to produce content that exudes passion and creativity in equal measure. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <a href="/contact"> NEED HELP WITH YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY?

<title>5 SOCIAL MEDIA ISSUES YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS TO FIX</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/5-critical-social-media-issues-your-business-needs-to-fix</link>
<description>Most social media users do not access the various social platforms with business in mind.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Most social media users do not access the various social platforms with business in mind. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1557804506-669a67965ba0.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Most social media users do not access the various social platforms with business in mind. There are, of course, some social sites like LinkedIn that are focused on business and employment.  <div> <br/> </div> <div> However, the majority of people using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other popular sites are looking to post and engage with interesting, humorous, and trending content. With the right techniques, though, it is still possible to build your brand and gain customers through effective social media activity. <div> <br/> <div> The way people use social media can cause issues for businesses who often get their approach wrong. While you might not damage your brand, you can lose followers and not get the returns you were hoping for. By fixing the following issues, you can ensure followers becoming engaged with your accounts, and your brand can grow. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Excessive Promotional Activities </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Users expect to see some promotional activity from brands, but it can potentially cross a line and become irritating. It may be simply that the volume of ads becomes too much, standing out negatively to followers. It could, however, be that the promotions are not engaging or inspiring. The best types of promotions offer value to consumers, even if they don't make a purchase. You could, for example, educate people on a related topic, and transition to product promotion. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Poor Customer Support </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> While you may not have intended to use social media for customer support, this is difficult to control. Users will often turn to their preferred social media platform instead of using a helpdesk. If you fail to answer customer questions or request for help, it will be noticeable to followers. Even if you are just directing each request to your helpdesk, it is better than ignoring people and simply posting content with no direct communication. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Lack of a Theme </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The best social media channels have recognisable themes, so followers know what to expect. Personal accounts might be diverse in their output, but this can feel incongruous to followers who become unsure of what your brand represents. Try to focus on a theme for each platform, ensuring it accurately represents your brand values. These themes can be created for sites based on images, text, and video. Of course, you don't want to become too generic, but a broad concept will help give you an identity. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Irrelevant Content </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> There can be a tendency for businesses to want to keep up a busy posting schedule. Posting frequently can work for some brands, typically when they have a social media team. If you don't have dedicated social media managers, though, it might be better to limit your content schedule. Posting frequently often leads to irrelevant content being used, usually not making much sense to followers of your brand. While you might want to comment on industry topics, make sure they are subjects that your followers will understand and be engaged with. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Misjudged Use of Trending Topics </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> There are new trending topics to be found across all the popular platforms. Popular brands can sometimes latch on to a trend, earning many likes and shares for creative use of the topic. Unfortunately, there is also the potential for mistakes to be made. A business might not fully understand the deeper concepts behind a trend and offend or upset some users. Trending topics are still a great way to develop social content, but it is important to be clear with what you are doing. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Social media can be a vital part of your business. Consumers expect to see a social media presence across all the major platforms, so it is important to take part in the process. When you have joined the major sites, though, you find that there is work involved. Avoiding these common issues ensures you are operating your sites to an optimal degree, providing users what they are looking for. Social media is not going away, so it is worth dedicating your time to developing this valuable marketing channel. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <a href="/contact"> NEED HELP WITH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY?

<description>SEO can be tricky to keep up with, especially as Google commonly changes their algorithms and makes it harder to reach the front page. However, there are a few strategies which often help businesses make it to the front page of Google.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> It can be hard to keep up with all the modern digital marketing terms these days, but it's especially important to know about SEO.  </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1562577309-2592ab84b1bc.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <div> SEO stands for search engine optimisation. In other words, it's a practice used to ensure that people can find your website when they use Google. So, how does SEO help your business? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Business owners need to take measures to improve their SEO. Customers nowadays often find businesses simply by searching Google, and it's important you climb up the Google rankings to make your company visible. But it isn't enough simply to have a website and there's a lot that goes into successful search engine optimisation.  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Here's a guide on how to use SEO for your business. </span> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> How Does SEO Help Your Business? </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Search engine optimisation can help your business in many ways. Most importantly, it helps connect your target audience to your business website. You can instantly draw potential customers in and, if you sell your products and services online, SEO can even make you some quick profit. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Think about how you'd find a product or service you need on Google. It's unlikely you'd scour through pages to find what you need, which is why it's essential to make your way to the front page of Google. This can take some time, but there are various measures you can take to improve your search ranking and make it to the front page for certain search terms. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> SEO covers a lot of methods which make your site more visible to potential customers and clients. Businesses that don't focus on SEO are likely to be beaten out by competitors more visible on Google. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> How to Use SEO for Your Business </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> SEO can be tricky to keep up with, especially as Google commonly changes their algorithms and makes it harder to reach the front page. However, there are a few strategies which often help businesses make it to the front page of Google. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> First of all, you need to focus on specific keywords and search terms. For instance, a clothing store will have far too much competition to show up on the first page of Google for "clothes." However, if you focus on more specific terms such as "affordable designer clothes in California," you could make it to the top of Google for your particular target market. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Websites often do this with their homepage, product pages, and various other pages to make themselves more visible. It also helps to build links between pages and attract links from outside sources. All of these things will help you improve your SEO over time. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> How to Use Content for SEO </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Many businesses nowadays also create tons of content. Not only can this attract more readers to your page, but it can also be a clever way to improve your SEO. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Blogs can be targeted at all kinds of search terms that your target market might look for. You can create blogs focused on specific keywords, questions, and products which customers are likely to search. What's more, you can link these blogs to other pages on your website and even entice customers to check out your products. In this sense, a customer might find one of your blogs on Google and end up making a purchase. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Content management systems such as WordPress make it easy for anyone to create content for their website. You can write blogs, add tags and images, and even use plugins such as Yoast SEO to drastically improve your visibility on Google. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Conclusion </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Every business nowadays needs to use SEO to attract more hits from Google. Not only can this attract more readers to your site, but you can also use your content to convert them into customers. While it's possible to take the do-it-yourself approach, many companies enlist the help of professional SEO agencies. This is one of the quickest and most effective ways to boost your hits and even gain more customers. </div> <div> <br/> <br/> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>WHY YOU NEED A SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER & HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO PAY</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/why-you-need-a-social-media-manager-and-how-much-you-need-to-pay</link>
<description>Rather than entrusting some rookie fresh out of uni with your company’s social media campaign, you should be looking at someone more experienced and well-versed in such matters. To be specific, someone professional.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> How much does it cost to outsource Social Media? </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1455849318743-b2233052fcff.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> So you run a business that’s doing pretty well for itself, have a pretty functional website, have an account on Facebook and Instagram, maybe Twitter too.   <span style="background-color: transparent;"> But wait, it’s been more than a month since you posted something on Facebook and you haven’t logged onto Twitter for ages. At least not since the intern you last dumped the chore on upped and left. Now you are thinking about where you noted down the username and password for the account. Well, good luck with that. </span> <div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> That’s the norm. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Rather than entrusting some rookie fresh out of uni with your company’s social media campaign you should be looking at someone more experienced and well-versed in such matters. To be specific, someone professional. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You can always dump the task on someone from sales or admin, of course. After all, you call the shots. But heaping an additional responsibility on some reluctant guy is not going to benefit anyone in the long run. If it works out for you, that’s great! But chances are that you stand to benefit a lot with someone dedicated to the task. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> How to benefit from Social Media </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The fact is that social media has evolved a lot in recent years, so much that even seasoned professionals have a tough time keeping up. There was a time when it was enough for a business or professional to have a page on Facebook with a few photo’s, the location and an occasional post (new year/holiday greetings!) </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Now it’s grown to become a parallel dimension in many ways. There’s a large section of people on it who are interested in you. They can be existing or prospective customers/clients or occasional professional partners/acquaintances. Social media definitely makes it easy to keep in touch with all of them. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> But done wisely, you can leverage your social connections to benefit your business. There is a right way to go about it, and you will need the right people for that. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> It all boils down to this: Do you need a dedicated person for Social Media? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Depends on you. You can appoint someone as an employee full-time or part-time, or opt for a consultant or agency. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The bigger you are, the more resources you’ll need. Behemoths like Pepsi and Nike have a virtual army of experts running their social campaigns. Even the local real estate agencies have dedicated in-house teams to manage their social efforts. For small scale businesses, it is better to outsource this task to a digital agency or an external consultant. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> So if you decide to go with someone for the job, who will you need? </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> That again depends on the social platforms you are on, what you plan to do on these networks, the size of your audience, any marketing or brand building initiative and so on. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Building a presence or image on social media platforms can be a round the clock process. An established and active presence will ensure that your SEO ranking goes up leading to more people discovering you and your brand. In addition, you will need regular content (blogs, posts, images, etc.), someone to address sales queries or customer issues, someone to engage with your audience on social networks and more. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> It’s best to opt for a Social Media Manager who can plan and execute your strategy, take care of the specifics and get the nitty-gritty done either in-house or outsource it. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> So how much can you expect to spend? </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> A cursory search on your favorite search engine (Google, of course!) will throw up rates all over the place along with a variety of fee structures – from $50/hour to thousands per project. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> However, it’s pretty simple to separate the wheat from the chaff. Check a few professional networking sites like the Glassdoor or LinkedIn or even surveys from the likes of Payscale. You’ll find that annual packages range from $50K to $150K with an average of around $70K. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> What you stand to benefit. </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The most important thing is to define the success and set goals for any new hire. It’s the same whether hiring a part time employee, a full-time social media manager, or a digital agency. Set out clear and specific goals (like say, 100 followers on FB or 25 customer queries on twitter) and be sure to review them at regular intervals. There’s got to be a quantifiable business return based on the money you spend. </div> <div> In this digital age, it is essential to have the right staff, structure, and budgets in place. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Remember, the choice lies with you. </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <a href="/social-media-services"> Social media content is fast moving. </a> You are only as good as your last good post. This is why it is vital to have constant updates on your social media pages. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> What if i told you, we can help with our service <a href="https://www.flatratesocialmedia.com" target="_blank"> Flat Rate Social Media </a> and plans start at $100 per week? </div> <div> <b> <a href="/contact"> Get in touch </a> </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <br/> </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> The reality is running a successful business has many moving parts and some of those parts are better off being outsourced to professional experts in their respective fields. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1549281899-f75600a24107.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> When you dreamt of opening up your own business you relished in the possibility of doing what you love while providing a valuable service or product to your customers. You probably did not consider at that time the hours you would also spend on things like accounting and marketing. The reality is running a successful business has many moving parts and some of those parts are better off being outsourced to professional experts in their respective fields, allowing you to focus on the core of your business and how you can continue to provide an exceptional product or service to your customers. <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Leave the Balancing of the Books to the Professionals </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Calculating payroll and balancing your books can be a time-consuming process for most business owners. By keeping your accounting in-house you are limiting the impact on your business by the most valuable resources you have available, yourself, and your talent.

<title>THE BIG ADVANTAGES OF SCHEDULING YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/the-big-advantages-of-scheduling-your-social-media-posts</link>
<description>Maintaining a consistent social media presence is essential to your small business's success</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Maintaining a consistent social media presence is essential to your small business's success </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/It%E2%80%99s+all+set+--+your+free+trial+of+SocialDashboard+is+up+and+running-3310x2415.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Maintaining a consistent <a href="https://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/4-ways-small-businesses-can-improve-their-social-media-presence" target="_blank"> social media presence is essential to your small business's success </a> , and there are many social media marketing tools that small business owners can take advantage of to keep a strong and cost-effective online profile. One of the best ways to execute your social media strategy is to schedule posts ahead of time.  <div> <br/> </div> <div> Here are the two biggest reasons why scheduling social media posts is a valuable strategy: <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b>   <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Scheduling encourages both consistency and variety of content. </span> </b> </div> <div> <b> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <br/> </span> </b> </div> <div> The further ahead you get with scheduling social media posts, the better you can execute your strategy and more easily see areas where marketing can be improved; for example, scheduling can ensure you're posting a good mix of visual and textual content and not relying too heavily on one or the other. Posting regularly also means better engagement and interaction with your audience. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b>   <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Scheduling gives you more time for other tasks. </span> </b> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> Posting content manually every day can easily become tiring or easily interrupted by unexpected circumstances. Scheduling posts takes away much of the stress of keeping up with regular social media activity and can help you stay on-message far into the future. Planning a month's worth of content around a particular theme ahead of time is much easier than coming up with daily posts at varying times. Don't feel completely locked in by the schedule, however — spontaneous manual posts are useful as well. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b>   <span style="background-color: transparent;"> But when is the best time to schedule posts to go up on your social networks?  </span> </b> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/" target="_blank"> Peak activity varies </a> a small amount from platform to platform. Most Facebook activity occurs on weekdays, usually between 10AM and 1PM; this is similar for Twitter as well. Instagram activity tends to peak later in the week between 8-10AM and after 2PM. However, business owners should take these trends into consideration and look at their own engagement numbers to determine the best strategy for social media activity. <a href="https://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/4-tips-to-follow-when-managing-your-business-on-social-media22f30bbd" target="_blank"> Limit posts to 1-2 times per day </a> to avoid overwhelming your audience, and be responsive to comments and direct messages.  </span> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <b> Need help developing your digital marketing strategy? <a href="https://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/contact" target="_blank"> Contact us for help! </a> </b> </span> </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>LEAD GENERATION STRATEGY</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/the-best-lead-generation-strategy-revealed</link>
<description>Your business won’t make any sales if it isn’t generating any leads.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Your business won’t make any sales if it isn’t generating any leads. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1580695315705-51afbcc21de4.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <div> Companies, big and small, have been carrying out lead generation strategies over the years. But with the growing use of technology, lead generation has become more complex.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Old marketing strategies relied on you finding the customer, but now Local SEO has now made it possible for the customer to find you. </div> <div> This is why you should focus on customer centric marketing principles. Here are a few simple but effective strategies. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Using a Powerful CTA </b> </div> <div> A good call to action that is both visible and powerful is the secret ingredient behind successful businesses. The CTA should clearly tell the visitor what your product or service is solving. Where you position your CTA is also important so that the visitor doesn’t spend too much time scrolling down. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Placing a Contact Form on Every Page </b> </div> <div> Now that you have won over your visitor, they want to reach out to you and get more information from customer representatives. The only problem is that they don’t know how. As their patience begins to thin out, the customer leaves your website and finds a competitor. Avoid this horror story by placing Contact Forms on every page so the visitor knows where to reach you. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Give Them Quality Content </b> </div> <div> Quality content that is meaningful and unique not only boosts your website’s rating on Google and search engines, but it also resonates well with customers. Useful and valuable content goes a long way in eliminating the marketplace trust deficit between you and your customer. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Designing an Effective Website </b> </div> <div> It is important to keep your website to the point and concise. Don’t clutter it with too much information by placing large chunks of text on the website. Your visitors could become bored and never visit back. Avoid this by making good use of menus and categories to make information easier to find. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Keeping Your Leads Engaged </b> </div> <div> Sometimes a consumer isn’t ready to purchase your product yet. Perhaps they are short of cash or are still in the phase of decision making. They could become valuable customers in the future, so it is important to keep them engaged with your business today. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The best way to attract customers is to provide them with a newsletter through email every week. This way you can provide them with helpful tips and information, and you can prepare them for the day when they finally convert into your customers. </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>HOW SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECTS BUYING DECISIONS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-social-media-affects-buying-decisions</link>
<description>The ways that Social Media effects buying decisions is something you can take advantage of.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Have you ever wondered how Social Media effects buying decisions? </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1573855619003-97b4799dcd8b.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Have you ever wondered how Social Media effects buying decisions? <div> <br/> <div> According to the stats, 71% of customers are more likely to make a purchase based on Social Media referrals.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Twitter is a top influencer when it comes to buying electronics. 49% of people use Facebook to find restaurants and 44% of potential customers say that they look for recommendations on their fave blogs before making a buying decision. That means you should not ignore the power of social media to influence people’s buying decisions. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Consider the fact that 32.5% of women say they’ve been influenced by a special promotion they saw on Facebook and moms are 45% more likely than other women to look for recommendations online before buying.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Those are figures you don’t want to ignore when women are still generally the decision-makers when it comes to buying household and baby products, and if you have a solid social media strategy in place, you can use those figures in a tactful way that makes women more likely to buy from you. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Although Facebook is still king when it comes to getting people talking about consumer products, you should not ignore other avenues for getting your products on social media sites. Blogs and forums are often overlooked in a social marketing strategy and the businesses that ignore these social media tools are missing out on sales. Adding a blog to your website is an excellent way to offer insider tips and tricks to maximize the value that potential customers get out of what you’re selling.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> While a well-moderated forum will discourage the posting of any links that look like an attempt to spam, most forums are a bit more lenient about links in a forum signature and it’s not very difficult to build your reputation as someone who knows your stuff by spending a half hour a day answering other members’ questions on the most active forums that are related to your niche. When 44% of automotive consumers look for advice on a forum, this can be a half hour a day well-spent in using social media to reach an audience. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Above all, the existence of Social Media means that you can get consumers to do part of the marketing-related leg work for you by sharing your posts and talking about your products. This is the entire reason that affiliate marketing exists, but you don’t necessarily need to have a formal affiliate marketing program to get people talking about what you have to offer. A typical conversation about a product might be, “Hey, you look good, have you been hitting the gym?” “Oh, sure, I’ve been going to ABC Boxing Club.” See, they just talked about a real membership gym called ABC Boxing Club. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The ways that Social Media effects buying decisions is something you can take advantage of. </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<description>Remember, first impressions count, so it is important that your visitors land on a website with a functional, attractive design so that that they’ll enjoy using it.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Remember, first impressions count, so it is important that your visitors land on a website with a functional, attractive design so that that they’ll enjoy using it. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1551810292-5b30a8a61f48.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Being attentive towards web design trends is essential for anyone who has an online presence. Remember, first impressions count, so it is important that your visitors land on a website with a functional, attractive design so that that they’ll enjoy using it. <div> <br/> <div> If your site is complicated, unprofessional or outdated, then users are more likely to close the tab and search another one. </div> <div> Take a look at these 5 web design elements you must be using to make your website look professional! </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Custom Visual Content </b> </div> <div> There are many places to track down stock photos online, but you will get much better results while featuring your own customised visual content, like your own photography and custom illustrations. These will reflect your brand in a better manner and fit the theme of your website more than another image. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Typography </b> </div> <div> You don’t have to stick to your old fonts. You can have fun with typography and that can be an exciting part of your web design. This can also help you to draw the user’s attention to the message which you wish to get across. Either you can use typography for your logo or tagline and even for the bulk text of your website. Also, introducing new fonts is a simple way to add variety to your site. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Animations </b> </div> <div> Animation is now becoming a popular trend and is frequently used on social media pages and brand websites. If traditional photography or imagery is not suitable for your brand theme, then go for an animation which could be a perfect alternative for photos. Remember that almost everything can be turned into an animation, so now is your chance to get creative and let your innovation reflect on your website. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Asymmetric Layouts </b> </div> <div> Until recent times, a number of designers used to prefer a rigid, perfectly symmetrical grid layout. But now, the times are changing. You can take a more casual and playful approach and include some fun asymmetric web layout, which are full of unexpected elements. This will help your web design to certainly stand out and enable the designer to be creative with its look and make it unique. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Dynamic Effects </b> </div> <div> Small dynamic effects are gaining popularity within the website owners as they give a fun touch to the website without being too loud of the design.Web designers are now choosing the effects such as sliding, bouncing, shaking or other moving elements. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> These effects are fairly easy to add to any web design and are therefore an ideal way to enhance your user experience without adding too much onto your budget. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Do you wish to inherit all these design elements in your website? And that too in a professional manner? Then Your Digital Agency is here for your help. Explore our website design services to see how we can put life back into your website! </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>DESIGNING A POWERFUL CALL TO ACTION</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/designing-a-powerful-call-to-action</link>
<description>To make sure that your CTA is sending the right message, avoid the use of generic messages such as “Buy Now” or “Click Here”. These messages fail to answer the two important questions.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Strong call to actions are the most important features of any landing page. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1534073828943-f801091bb18c.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <b> Strong call to actions are the most important features of any landing page. </b> <div> <br/> </div> <div> The only problem is that most businesses don’t know of its importance and, hence, don’t use them. In your digital strategy, every tool and arsenal in your marketing strategy counts.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Businesses need to make their appeals strong enough for potential leads to click on them and to convert into customers. If you are serious about writing a powerful call to action, consider using the following principles to drive the message forward. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Increasing Visibility </b> </div> <div> Don’t hide your call-to-action under giant walls of text. Your leads won’t click on them if they can’t even find the call to action. Experts believe that you should place the call to action somewhere above or below the fold (upper half of the webpage).  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Consider changing the color palette and theme of your CTA to make it stand out from other areas of the page. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> To make your CTA even more attractive, try using rounded buttons to increase the number of visitors to follow your desired action. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> A Clear Message </b> </div> <div> Another problem with many CTAs is the presence of a lackluster message. No matter how good the design of your CTA is, if it doesn’t have a strong and compelling message, visitors won’t follow through.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> To solve this dilemma, you can design your CTA by answering the following questions: </div> <div> <ul> <li> What do you want your visitors to do? </li> <li> Why should they follow through? </li> </ul> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> To make sure that your CTA is sending the right message, avoid the use of generic messages such as “Buy Now” or “Click Here”. These messages fail to answer the two important questions. Instead, you can use a powerful sentence, such as “Get Your Swimming Gear and Start Swimming!” It solves both questions and doesn’t take more than a few words. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Additionally, you can also try creating a sense of emergency, such as “Now”, “Tomorrow”, or “Today”,to prompt visitors to follow through. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Using Supporting Elements </b> </div> <div> Supporting elements can be images or testimonials.  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> But it is absolutely essential that you don’t overdo it. Some support elements could come across as too strong and may discourage the visitor to click.  </span> </div> <div> <span style="background-color: transparent;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> If you are using testimonials, you need to make sure they are real. If you are using pictures, make sure they are relevant enough to support the CTA. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> It might look like extra work, but when you compare the improved website results and action rates, it will feel like time well spent. </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>FACEBOOK ANALYTICS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/facebook-analytics-5-must-track-metrics</link>
<description>You should have three goals in mind: Reach as many people as possible. Experience positive growth. Track the appropriate metrics to pinpoint your successes, failures, and potential strategy changes</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> 5 Must Track Analytics </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1535303311164-664fc9ec6532.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Now it’s time to take a closer look at Facebook analytics, including five must-track metrics. <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Fans </b> </div> <div> Fans, fans, and more fans. There is nothing more important than this, right? While there are other metrics to track, this one definitely deserves your attention.  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> In short, this is the cumulative number of people that like your page. Breaking this down, pay close attention to your daily, weekly, and monthly growth. </span> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Shares </b> </div> <div> Posting content to Facebook is a good thing. Having this content shared by others is powerful.  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> You should track the shares of content on your page by day, week, and month. Just the same as fans, you want to experience positive growth. And shares are more powerful than likes since the content someone is sharing is actually displayed on their page. </span> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Comments </b> </div> <div> Much the same as shares, this is an “engagement” metric. It shows that people are doing more than reading your content. They are also commenting, giving you valuable feedback that can help you generate a more targeted Facebook marketing strategy. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Likes </b> </div> <div> Likes have been driving the Facebook engine since day one. In the same mold as shares and comments, likes show that your audience is interested in what you’re saying.  <span style="background-color: transparent;"> A steady increase in likes shows that your audience is growing and your content is “sticking.” </span> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Reach </b> </div> <div> Facebook marketing success is all about activity. You want to reach as wide an audience as possible. Furthermore, you want to track your reach (also referred to as impressions). With this metric, you can track the number of people who could have seen any activity on your page, such as: posts by the page, posts by other people, page links, mentions (and more). </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Final Word </b> </div> <div> With more than 2.23 billion daily active users, Facebook provides the opportunity to reach a humongous audience.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> You should have three goals in mind:  </div> <div> <ol> <li> Reach as many people as possible. </li> <li> Experience positive growth. </li> <li> Track the appropriate metrics to pinpoint your successes, failures, and potential strategy changes </li> </ol> </div> <div> <br/> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>STORYTELLING TIPS TO CREATE YOUR NEXT SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/three-storytelling-tips-to-create-your-next-social-media-content-calendar</link>
<description>Create a template. Experiment with themes. Tell and share good stories.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> A social media content calendar provides the blueprint for your social media communications.   </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/md/unsplash/dms3rep/multi/photo-1554177255-61502b352de3.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> A social media content calendar provides the blueprint for your social media communications.   <div> <br/> <div> It’s a plan that takes out the guesswork of what you’ll be creating, sharing, and talking about with your customers and followers.But what kind of content should you create and share? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> The Hero’s Journey </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Everyone loves a hero. Everyone loves the villain. All of us, at times, are a little of both. Tapping into the journey of the hero and/or the villain in storytelling will help you to build an interesting social media content calendar. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> TIP 1 </b> </div> <div> Operating a business is hard work. We’re so busy that we forget to reflect how far we’ve come. We forget why we went into business in the first place.  </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Take five minutes out of your schedule right now to answer the following questions. Don’t deliberate about it. It’s not a test. Just write the first thing that comes into your mind, then move on: </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> 1. Why did you start your business? <br/> 2. What are two major challenges you faced? <br/> 3. What’s the best thing that’s happened to you in business? <br/> 4. How have you sabotaged your own success, if at all? </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> TIP 2 </b> </div> <div> Now brainstorm how you can translate this into content.  </div> <div> Could you create a blog post, a graphic, a whitepaper, a YouTube video?  </div> <div> Don’t worry if you’re not up to speed on how to create these types of content. When you’re ready, you can outsource them. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> TIP 3 </b> </div> <div> Social media for business is not a strategy unto itself. It’s a tool.  </div> <div> Look at your answers. What do you notice? Is there a common thread? Are there recurring themes?  </div> <div> Segment these into seven columns (eg: column 1 – mental health; column 2 – brain food, column 3 – the importance of sleep). </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Now change each number to correspond with the days of the week.  </div> <div> Column 1 becomes Monday. Column 2 becomes Tuesday.  </div> <div> This is your social media content template.  </div> <div> Each Monday you’ll share content about mental health. Tuesday will be about brain food. Wednesdays are about good or bad sleep. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Create a template. Experiment with themes. Tell and share good stories. </b> </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>SOCIAL MEDIA FOR INTROVERTS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/social-media-for-introverts</link>
<description>Social media, does that mean that I have to be social?” Not necessarily. With these fail-proof tips, you can successfully market your business, without needing to morph from the safety of your quiet cocoon into a socially extroverted butterfly.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> It’s all about content. Really. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/jumpstory-download20200120-070527.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> For those of us whom the world considers to be ‘introverted’, the idea of putting our business out on social media can be daunting. </span> <div> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> <br/> </span> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> “Social media, does that mean that I have to be social?” Not necessarily. With these fail-proof tips, you can successfully market your business, without needing to morph from the safety of your quiet cocoon into a socially extroverted butterfly. </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> It’s all about content. Really. </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> Social media for business isn’t about sharing intimate details of your bright and vibrant lifestyle. Your readers are seeking informative, engaging and authentic content. Write what you know, not to sell, but to share, and set yourself as a market leader in your industry. </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> Consumers are visually orientated. </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> That means: videos, images, memes, branded graphics, gifs, logos. Make your content visually appealing and captivating, but don’t forget the importance of white space. Use videos where you can – research shows that Gen Y prefer movies to novels, and tubes (think YouTube) over long wordy blog posts. Not comfortable making your own videos featuring Yours Truly? Go back to point 1. It’s all about content. Re-share videos that relate to the subject matter of your brand: educate your audience. </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> Get friendly with your camera, and work on your brand development. </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> Social media for business should be just as much about developing your brand and creating brand awareness in your audience, as it is about promoting a special on a good or service, (if not more so!). Let nature feature in your brand to create a beautiful news feed: oceanography, nature shots, sunshine or snow, embrace the sun, sand and water to make your brand appeal to your audience. </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> Social media isn’t just for extroverts, it’s for us introverts too. It’s about promoting and marketing our brands, authentically rather than loudly. Sharing a message, quietly if you like (there’s no need to shout from the rooftops after all), but creating a reach above-and-beyond what you’d achieve using print media or traditional marketing techniques alone. </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <br/> </span> </div> <div> <span style="font-weight: normal;"> It doesn’t have to be scary, or in-your-face, or obnoxious. Social media for your business may mean a beautiful Instagram / Facebook feed building layer-upon-layer of content to show your audience who your brand is, what you represent, why you exist and where they can purchase your goods or services. </span> </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<description>Having a social media presence is essential for your small business’ success, so give us a call to find out more about how we can help you grow your online influence.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Having a social media presence is essential for your small business’ success, so give us a call to find out more about how we can help you grow your online influence. </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/jumpstory-download20200120-070306.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Marketing a small business is a challenge for most business owners due to limited resources and personnel. <div> <br/> <div> However, you can leverage the power of social media to market your small business in a powerful yet cost-effective way. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Below are four ways small businesses can improve their marketing strategies by growing their social media presence. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Carefully select social media platforms depending on the audience </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Knowing which platforms to use so that you can reach your target audience easily is the first step towards social media marketing success. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, for example, are great platforms that can help you reach millions of people. The platform that you choose should also guide you when creating content for your marketing strategy. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Consider your enterprise goals and plans </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> It is advisable that you take time to figure out what content you want on your social media posts. You should be passionate and familiar with the issues you choose. Go for topics that your customers will find valuable in their daily lives. The content should also reflect the objectives and ethos of your business. </div> <div> <b> <br/> </b> </div> <div> <b> Ensure that you stay up-to-date with your social media posts </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Social media posts offer two-way communication between businesses and their customers. Ensure you commit to staying current with all the posts and reply to all your customers. Take time to respond to customers’ questions and thank them for positive feedback. You should also acknowledge negative feedback and promise to sort out any issues with your products or services that leave your customers unsatisfied. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> Keep all your posts clear and consistent </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> As an SME, it’s unlikely you’ll have a member of staff to spare for the sole purpose of running social media. This can sometimes make it difficult to maintain an on-brand tone throughout all your posts if everyone is chipping in. Make sure all of your team understand what’s expected of them and the kind of content and responses to questions they should be delivering. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Having a social media presence is essential for your small business’ success, so give us a call to find out more about how we can help you grow your online influence. </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>WAYS TO REACH MILLENNIALS WITH SOCIAL MEDIA</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/3-ways-to-reach-millennials-with-social-media-posts</link>
<description>Millennials are a hard target market to capture. While every generation is slightly different, millennials grew up at the same time the Internet emerged and exploded.</description>
<content:encoded><h3 style="transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out 0s;"> Millennials are a hard target market to capture.  </h3> <div> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/jumpstory-download20200120-070212.jpg"/> </div> <div style="transition: none 0s ease 0s; display: block;" data-rss-type="text"> Millennials are a hard target market to capture. While every generation is slightly different, millennials grew up at the same time the Internet emerged and exploded. <div> <br/> <div> That means the same trends and marketing techniques that worked across previous generations with just a bit of tweaking were turned entirely on their head. Marketing shouldn’t be interruptive; it should be ready and waiting. It shouldn’t be a presentation; it should be interactive. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> And that’s where social media comes in. No matter what platform you’re focusing on, social media is the perfect place to promote a quick idea, get positive attention, and step away. Let your target market grow familiar with your brand without setting off any alarms or being boring. Here’s how to do it. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> 1. Don’t clickbait </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Clickbait and answers that are too good to be true don’t work as well on millennials. Most know the warning signs and can point out bad deals with accuracy, and they’ll just scroll on past them. That doesn’t mean they don’t work in some situations, but it does mean it’s not worth the risk. When you’re in a highly competitive market, your brand’s good name is worth everything. So don’t make your prospective customers distrust you. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> 2. Split your content into useful snippets </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> Social media posts need to be either entertaining or useful. It’s even better if the posts are both. If you have any lists or tips in your business blog content, transform the tips or topics one by one into social media posts. If millennials see you as a source of good and relevant information, they’re going to subscribe to your channel. It’s also a good way to incentivise them to click on your article for the rest of the tips. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> <b> 3. Ask for one action and then end the interaction </b> </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> YouTubers joke about the original call to action: like, comment, and subscribe. All three actions are important for your brand, but the joke is that no one should be asking for all three. This is even truer on social media. Your call to action should have one action only. Then leave it up to the viewer. </div> <div> <br/> </div> <div> If you would like more advice on social media for business, simply contact us at www.yourdigitalagency.com.au  </div> </div> </div></content:encoded>

<title>GROWTH DRIVEN DESIGN</title>

<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A website redesign is a tedious process. Unfortunately, it is also a procedure necessary for keeping a website relevant to users and search engines. Users’ needs and preferences are constantly in flux, as are that of search engine algorithms. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Depending on the industry you are in or the target audience you have, you may need to redesign as frequently as every few years. Consequently, web redesign is a time-consuming, expensive, and challenging endeavour. </p> </div> <h3 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> What makes traditional website projects so hard? </h3> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Web design is more than just creating a beautiful or modern website. It is a thoroughgoing process that begins with planning and strategising. There are also competitors to consider, as well as the changing needs and preferences of your target audience. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The audience research aspects of web projects are tasks that can’t be done in just a day or two. Because traditional website projects involve limited funding and deadlines to beat, the research aspect tends to be done roughshod. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Of course, there won’t be any feedback or post-launch data incorporated into the initial design itself, which further reduces the overall effectiveness and responsiveness of the website and its features. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The many features that need to be incorporated into the website would require a lot of people. Moreover, these features have to be prioritised and streamlined to complement each other. The website and its features should also provide a seamless user experience despite its  complexity. The different skill levels and work attitudes of the people involved in the web design team would affect overall performance. </p> </div> <h3 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> What makes the growth-driven design different from traditional web design? </h3> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Tasks that are associated with traditional web design end once a website has been launched online. When the time comes for redesign, the web designing team will have to cram all their tasks in a short time. This wasteful, inefficient process repeats itself every time the website needs to be redesigned. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> On the other hand, growth-driven design (GDD) operates on the premise of continuous improvement. This means that the web design team will not have to wait for the next redesign period to incorporate feedback and improvements. Once a website’s shortcomings are identified, they would be addressed, no matter how trivial these glitches are. The improvements accrue over time, resulting in a more responsive website that quickly adapts to changes in the needs and behaviour of users and search engines. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> It might sound too good to be true, but you can see the proof in the details of how GDD works. As mentioned earlier, GDD does not have to wait for so long to implement improvements in the website’s design. GDD is deliberately phased into smaller-scale projects that incorporate improvements and implement changes as soon as a website needs them. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> In contrast, web redesign in the traditional framework is treated as a large, rigid project that needs to be started on Date X and finished on Date Y. In a fast-paced world, it is indeed absurd to wait for months or years until Date X comes just to start enacting much-needed changes on a website. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Because of how GDD streamlines improvement and redesign tasks into manageable chunks, the process of redesigning becomes more cost-effective in the long run. Moreover, preparing the budget for smaller, near-term projects tends to be more predictable since the prices of supplies and services needed are already known and won’t change drastically. As such, GDD projects incur fewer overruns or allocation deficits, compared to long-term budgeting for traditional projects. </p> </div> <h4 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> If you're looking to create a new website for your small business, get in touch with us today for a free consultation on how we can help! </h4></content:encoded>

Most of these options have been limited due to Instagram's API restrictions on what third-party tools can access, and how they can post - though Instagram did provide capacity for third party providers to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-will-now-enable-businesses-to-schedule-posts-via-third-party-tool/515919/"> facilitate Insta scheduling last year </a> . </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This new option, however, provides increased capacity, in that you can better see exactly what your Insta posts will look like, which is similar to posting to a Facebook Page natively, as opposed to through a scheduling app. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The team from <a href="https://later.com/"> Later </a> have <a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-creator-studio-guide/"> provided an in-depth rundown of the process </a> - first off, if you want to schedule your Instagram posts, you need to have an Instagram business account linked to your Creator Studio dashboard. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>3 Tips on How to Increase Your Online Presence With a Professional-Looking Website</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/3-tips-on-how-to-increase-your-online-presence-with-a-professional-looking-website</link>
<description>A website should not just look pleasing but serve a purpose. Make sure that yours helps you towards your business goals and encourages people to stick around.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Your audiences have a set of expectations from your brand or line of business. Unless you want to be a trailblazer in web design, you have to toe the line of professional look that befits your business. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> At the same time, however, your site should stand out from the rest, in terms of user experience (UX) and appearance alike. Internet users only browse from two to three seconds, and those few seconds may make or break a lead for you. You also have to design a website that is more than what meets the eye. It should last indelibly on your target audience’s psyche that they would want to share it with their friends and business networks. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> How do you achieve such a design? We have a few tips for you. </b> </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 1) Make a good impression in a snap </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Since your website is your business’s face on the internet, its appearance naturally extends to the way that people will perceive your organisation offline. You want a design that reinforces your reputation, bolsters your business’s brand and propagates awareness of your business the moment your visitor sees your site. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The importance of your web design works the same way as conducting business offline—spick and span offices are likely to seal the deals for businesses’ clients. Your office should also be arranged or located in a way that it is easy for potential clients to look for you. If you’re an owner of an e-commerce site, the products you sell should be arranged neatly and displayed seamlessly. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A minimalist and clean layout is what a professional-looking website is all about. Your website’s colour contrasts, fonts, and backgrounds should all make it appear that you are a serious business owner. Your website’s design should go beyond aesthetics and make a good impression the instant your visitors click on the tabs or links. Generate positive word of mouth on social media so that more people will visit your website and boost its visibility. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 2) Optimise your site for search engines </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Imagine trying to locate a maker of high-quality pair of shoes you’ve heard about but who is unfortunately not on the local map. No matter how good your products are, no one will know that you exist if you’re not on the map. Search engine optimisation (SEO) somehow works the same way as a map, except that it applies to the online world. As was previously mentioned, your site should be easy to find for most people, especially your target audiences. If they type words related to your company or your line of business, you want your website to appear first on their search engines. That’s because up to 95% of search engine users ignore page results outside of the first page. You are missing out on a lot of potential traffic if you don’t optimise your site for both search engine bots and human users. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> SEO, which is about achieving a higher search ranking, involves designing your website to make it easier and faster for search engines to pluck your site and make it appear first on search engine results. SEO also involves producing a positive user experience for your visitors. Positive user experience reduces your website’s bounce rate, boosts your traffic, and increases your “use value” for search engine algorithms. The higher your “use value” or reliability, the more likely the search engine bots will choose to display your site on the search engine results of your target audience. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 3) Make your site mobile friendly </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> With more and more people browsing the internet through their phones, your website’s design should appear seamless even when viewed through people’s smartphones. Google has recently made changes in its algorithm that prioritises sites that are easy to use and view in both smartphones and computers. Because the world of mobile is in constant flux, your website’s design should also adapt continuously at the same time. Only then will you be able to ensure traffic for your site and growth for your business. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Conclusion </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A website should not just look pleasing but serve a purpose. Make sure that yours helps you towards your business goals and encourages people to stick around. Our tips will guide you on your journey to creating a more professional-looking site. Good luck! </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>WORKING WITH CREATIVE AGENCIES, 3 TIPS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/3-tips-for-startups-working-with-creative-agencies-what-to-look-out-for</link>
<description>Keen on tapping into your potential and growing beyond your target sales and business goals with a creative agency? Here are a few tips that you need to keep in mind:</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> When working with a creative agency comes to mind, most people think about a makeover that’s going to reel in all the attention and customers that they’ll ever need. While this may be true to some extent, getting a creative agency to help out can also prove to be a risky investment. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The best creative agencies to work with are led by creative founders who know what they’re doing and have a significant amount of experience under their belt. Unfortunately, finding one that truly stands out can be difficult because their client list fills up quickly. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> While any account executives worth their salt can persuade you that you need their agency to succeed, top-rate agencies that aim to deliver the best work every time will not take you on as a client too quickly. The reason behind this is simple: they tend to be selective of who they work with. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> The Difficulty of Finding a Creative Agency to Work With as a Startup </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Creative agencies are often much more selective when it comes to startup clients. After all, startups aren’t as stable as established companies. Seeing as the failure of a company reflects the work of a creative agency and can damage their reputation, it makes sense that they would choose to work with only the best. If you are fortunate enough to be able to work with a creative agency, it’s crucial for you to tread carefully. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Finding a creative agency to work with as a startup can be challenging. The difficulty is due to the fact that most creative agencies sell services beyond the value of what most small businesses need. This disparity in value can prove to be a relatively complicated issue to tackle because the incentives of most agencies aren’t always aligned with that of a startup. With the right tips in mind, however, it can be much easier to find a creative agency that’s perfect for your business. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 3 Tips for Startups Working With Creative Agencies </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style=";margin:0px;"> Keen on tapping into your potential and growing beyond your target sales and business goals with a creative agency? Here are a few tips that you need to keep in mind: </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 1. Start your run with a clear point of view, and make sure you can defend it </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A huge mistake that many startups make when working with a creative agency is falling short of retaining the vital essence of their branding. This loss of identity often occurs when business owners don’t have a clear idea of the gaps in the market that they are filling, the type of customers that they are serving, and more. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> It’s important that you know how to defend your business when it is subject to the scrutiny of an agency executive. When working with a creative agency, make sure to bring strong POVs on customer profiles, acquisition channels, and every other detail of your startup. Aside from that, be sure that you can defend your perspectives because no agency will know your business better than you do. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 2. Establish your limitations </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Failing to prepare in terms of costs can be a big waste of time and energy. The best way to ensure that the process goes smoothly is to establish financial limits. Otherwise, you may end up painting a pretty picture of what you want to achieve, only for your hopes to be dashed when your agency gives you the cost estimate of what it will take to get there. Some ideas are amazing on paper but can easily become a nightmare when they’re fleshed out in dollar amounts. Establish your limitations ahead of time so your creative agency can show you what they can achieve while keeping you on budget. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 3. Watch out for any shady tactics </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Navigating the entire branding process can prove to be a challenge for non-creatives. It’s easy for agency jargon and the thought of incredible results to cloud up the view of a branding proposal’s true effectivity. The best way to avoid falling into any problems during the branding process is to have a “thought partner” who can help identify any holes in a creative agency’s proposal. This way, both you and your creative agency can avoid making costly mistakes. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Conclusion </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Working with a creative agency can yield some remarkable results, but that doesn’t mean it comes without a fair share of challenges. Our tips will help you maximise your results and minimise the hassle. Give them a try today! </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> If you're looking for a digital marketing agency to help you streamline your growth, get in touch with us today to see how we can help! <br/> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>Our Three-Step Guide to Building The Perfect Fashion Website</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/our-three-step-guide-to-building-the-perfect-fashion-website442d134f</link>
<description>How can you create a website that helps your fashion business thrive? Here are a few tips to keep in mind</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> If you ask the very same people about website design, however, your question will most likely be met with an awkward pause. Regardless of how in-demand a fashion brand’s clothing items are, it’s easy to miss out on sales because of a number of other mistakes. Smaller brands have to worry about fast-fashion retailers that steal designs, established designers that are hard to go against, and even weak brand authority. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Wait—let’s take a moment to focus on that final point (that you probably have a few questions about): weak brand authority. Today, the online world is the domain on which brands make a name for themselves. Some fashion entrepreneurs are still under the impression that an online presence isn’t that important for running a successful fashion brand, but the truth is that it’s a difference-maker that can boost your sales and drive brand recognition. There are hundreds of thousands of fashion businesses that have their own way of catering to a customer’s desire to look stylish—a truth that justifies the fact that you’ll need to play to your strengths. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> With social media, you can expect to see your fashion business rise above your competitors, especially when your designs stand out in the eyes of your customers. There is a whole array of different platforms that you can work with, but the best platform you can go with as a fashion business is a website. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Effective website building tips </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> How can you create a website that helps your fashion business thrive? Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you put a one-stop web portal together for your customers to enjoy: </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 1. Choose the right web developer to work with </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Just like a great selection of clothing products for your business, having an attractive, functional, and high-quality website can impact the way the word about your brand goes around. The greatest way to ensure that your website looks, feels, and performs well is to hire the right web developer for the job. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Seek one who has experience building websites for fashion brands. A great way to source out web development talent for your fashion business is to consult with different established web design firms. They are most likely to have copious amounts of experience in the industry and a list of extremely satisfied clientele. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 2. Narrow down your options with the help of portfolios </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> One thing that both the fashion and web development industries have in common is the presence of portfolios. If fashion businesses and designers have lookbooks, then web designers have portfolios that can convince clients and businesses about the quality of work that they can expect. With lots of options to choose from in terms of web developer on the market, one of the easiest ways to streamline the process is to look at the portfolio of different service providers. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 3. Go for fashion blog-style website content </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Aside from planning for the website’s inner workings, appearance, back-end, and front-end, one important part to watch out for is the content that ties your website together. There are different ways fashion businesses can make the most out of their websites, but no format works better to attract customers than fashion blogs. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Fashion blogs are a type of content that well-known fashion brands around use to engage with and provide value to customers. Most consumers are out and about on the internet looking for new information. When inserting a blog portion into your website, you may want to look into hiring the services of a professional blog writer or ghostwriter. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>TIPS TO FOLLOW WHEN MANAGING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESS</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/4-tips-to-follow-when-managing-your-business-on-social-media22f30bbd</link>
<description>When trying to run your business on social media, it’s important to note that you should have a complete and accurate profile.

<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> When you look at it from an interactive standpoint, you’ll find that social media is quite interesting in terms of how people represent themselves, specifically in regards to how they act, what they say, and what they’re interested in. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> With billions of people on social media, the idea of the digital platform becoming a new planet or continent in its entirety is an idea that isn’t too far fetched. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Compared to the earlier expectations of social media population numbers, amassing billions of users online is far from what was expected of different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram — an unexpected development that has caught the attention of millions of brands, companies, and service providers. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> The advantage of taking your business to social media </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Although most objected at first, businesses use social media to maximise their profit potential and their audience impact to improve business growth, which in turn has made taking a business online non-negotiable when trying to thrive and survive in the digital age. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> With a large number of consumers with cash at the ready just surfing around online for the majority of the day, businesses need to take the extra steps to ensure that their voice can reach potential customers on the web. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Rather than go for the standard “buy now” approach and other traditional business tactics, businesses and corporations have given their image a boost by carrying out their brand identity through social media in a way that makes their image look like a person that consumers can relate to. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> By using captivating brand identities, using the right tonalities, and opening themselves up for consumer interaction, businesses that have social media-driven marketing strategies are enjoying and will continue to enjoy a boost that will allow them to reach their goals much faster. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> What you need to know about running your business online </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> While the concept of freedom runs rampant in terms of how people use social media, it doesn’t go the same way for businesses. Compared to an individual social media user, businesses on social media are held to a higher standard and are more vulnerable to relentless scrutiny if they make a mistake. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Getting things done the wrong way on social media can result in negative publicity that can harm your business’ sales, its image, and its standing compared to the other competitors. Business’ online are working even harder to ensure that they don’t cross any lines on social media because taking one step too far can make the difference between a business doing well or being prepared to fail. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> When trying to run a business on social media, it’s also important to note that your own profile and that of your employees and other people in the organization can also severely affect the way things will go in the future. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Having an employee post something bigoted or allowing a high-level executive to post something sensitive (see: Elon Musk) can cause sales to drop and stock prices to go down. For this reason, it’s incredibly important to have everything under control on social media when running a business. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 4 tips you’ll have to follow when managing your business on social media </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> In order to avoid having your business end up on the wrong side of things on social media, here are a few things you need to do and watch out for when trying to establish a strong brand online: </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 1. Strike a balance in your online presence </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Here’s the thing about thriving as a business on social media: if you don’t use social media, clients and customers will think that you’re no longer operational. Many of them will forget you and move on to other providers of the same products and services. If you’re using it too much, on the other hand, your audience will think that you’ve thrown professionalism out the window entirely. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style=";margin:0px;"> When trying to run your business on social media, it’s important to note that you should have a complete and accurate profile. Make sure that you limit your posting to around 1-2 times a day (unless you’re an information source or a news outlet) and stay responsive in your page’s inbox as well. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 2. Don’t get involved in the wrong conversations </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> No client or customer would want to get anything from a business that engages in conversations that they shouldn’t be involved in. This is a fact, and definitely a non-negotiable when doing business on social media. Discussing personal issues (such as politics, sex, drugs and alcohol, anything bigoted, or anything violent) can point your prospective customers towards the other direction and strip you of any opportunities for deals to be made. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 3. Avoid sharing the wrong content </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Memes: they can crack up a laugh every time they pop up on your feed, are definitely share-worthy, and remind you of fond memories — but do they really even belong on your business page to begin with? Sharing content that isn’t in your niche and putting out nonsensical posts can harm your social media standing as a business, so it’s best to steer clear of anything that isn’t related to your products or services. Stick to what helps your business present itself as credible in the eyes of consumers. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> 4. Create valuable content </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This is one of the most underutilised, yet effective tips that you can follow when trying to run your business on social media, especially because quality content can help you stand out in the best way possible. When forming your business’s identity online, you’ll want to consider creating a social media plan for what you’re going to post, when you’ll have to post it, and how much you’ll have to share it. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Truth be told, posting valuable content on social media will help with your goals online. It can definitely amp up the sales rates that you’ll be making through your sales funnel. If you’re unsure of how you could go about with this step, it’s best to contact a digital marketing agency to take care of how you’ll be putting valuable content out on social media. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>10 Quick Social Media Marketing Tips</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/10-quick-social-media-marketing-tips</link>
<description>Here are quick must-know tips you should consider when rolling out your next social media campaign.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Most Social Media marketing campaigns are designed to help gain more social following, increase product/brand visibility or drive traffic to a website. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 1. Reserve your username across all platforms </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Reserve all your usernames across all the Social Media platforms even if you don’t need them now. These keeps off trolls, and trust me; you are going to need those usernames some day. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 2. Decide which platform(s) best suits your needs. </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Not all Social Media platforms are suitable for your kind of marketing campaign. Trying to build a presence and stay significantly active on all available Social Media platforms can be time consuming and counterproductive. Instead, you need to identify platforms that bring the best results and focus on them. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 3. Optimise your Social Media platforms </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Once you’ve decided on the platform you intent to use, focus on optimising your profiles in order to get more followers. A few things to consider include using a real profile picture, write clear and comprehensive about pages for your profiles, and where applicable, include a link to your website. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 4. Connect your Social Media accounts to your website </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Having all your active accounts connected to your websites helps to keep the conversation going. Visitors on your website can link to any of the listed accounts and your followers on Social Media can find out more about your offer. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 5. Find and follow leaders in your niche. </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Find the most influential people in your niche and follow or fave them. Chances are they will share useful information about your niche or share their progress about a certain project; and you can look over their shoulders for inspiration. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 6. Don’t forget the hashtags </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Most people use hashtags to search for topics on Social Media. And it’s a nice way to make your stuff (like you upcoming product launch) trend on Facebook or Instagram. Just don’t overdo it. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 7. Stay social </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Whether you are running a personal profile or company/brand’s Social Media account, you need to stay social and interactive. Follow other users, send friend requests, comment on posts, like other people’s stuff, update your status regularly, share interesting things and so on. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 8. Stay out of trouble </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Each platform has its own sets of rules, and some rules cut across all the networks. For instance, Twitter has a limit on how many people you can follow per day, Facebook has restriction on friend-requesting people you don’t know and so on. Always play by the rules and the terms of service of each network. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 9. Track mentions </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This is where PR kicks in. Use available tools to track every mention of your brand across all platforms and find out what people are saying about you or your brand. Don’t miss a chance to neutralise any negative talk. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> 10. Post as many times per day but again, don’t overdo it. </b> </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The number of times to post per day will depend on the social network, the numbers of your followers and how interactive your audience is. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>ONLINE TRENDS DIGITAL MARKETING</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/11-online-marketing-trends-you-should-keep-in-mind</link>
<description>Marketing has come a long way from what it once was a decade ago. Recent trends should not be ignored since they signal what consumers want. Developing brand awareness and interacting with your audience are important in business today.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> In the new world of digital marketing, new emerging web trends emerging are commonplace. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> These new techniques can play a huge role in how you interact with consumers. To enhance marketing efforts, you need to keep up. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> While it is challenging to predict the most effective marketing methods, you have to pay attention to patterns in your customer's purchase behaviour. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Integrate Different Kinds of Marketing </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> If you want to make the most of your marketing efforts, you should integrate mobile, social, and online marketing. Although dabbling in one of these media may bring impressive results, you will only realise your full potential by tapping all three fields. This increases exposure increases efficiency, which contributes positively to your marketing campaigns. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Tap Micro-Influencers </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Today, brands acknowledge the reach and power of influencers. Fielding powerful influencers and celebrities is relatively easy yet costly. When choosing your promotional team, do not pay attention to only numbers; take a look at a person's engagement rates as well. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Alternatively, you could focus on low-following influencers for your campaigns. Not only do micro-influencers provide great content, but their followers can also relate to them since they are still considered "regular" people. This market allows you to reduce costs because micro-influencers charge significantly less than mid- to high-profile influencers. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Keep Your Marketing Funnel Concise </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Many companies see everyone as their consumers. For an effective marketing strategy, know the demographics and persona of your buyers. This allows you to target your niche audience rather than continue with a large funnel designed for everyone. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Releasing targeted ads to potential customers is more cost efficient. Consumers want to experience a genuine relationship with a brand they trust. So, speaking directly to targeted consumers is more effective in developing trust and stronger relationships with your followers. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Content Is Key </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Quality content must be your priority when developing promotional materials. Since you know what your audience wants, use your content to excite them, and provoke their buying behaviour. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> You should not simply aspire to deliver content and hope for engagement; instead, you should encourage them to share your content and encourage dialogue. Whether you want to focus on photos, videos, or articles, make sure to inspire two-way communication to let your customers know that you value their input. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Focus on Gen Z </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Generation Z is getting older. In just a few years, they will represent one of the biggest markets. The second youngest generation loves authentic content. They also lean more towards businesses that are ethically conscious since they want companies that make the world better. Position your brand in a way that appeals to these principles. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Consumers Are Marketers </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Traditionally, brands supply content to their audiences. Now, this one-way flow is no longer as restrictive. Effective word-of-mouth marketing allows customers to be advocates for your brand. Provide your customers with opportunities to become brand advocates. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Reconsider Chatbots </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Customer service is everything. However, not everyone is willing to talk to customer service providers on the phone or through e-mail. To help save time and become more efficient, go with chatbots, which are artificial intelligent (AI) assistants that can answer your customer's questions. By 2025, the chatbot market will amount to 1.2 billion, which shows how valuable chatbots are to businesses today. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Turn to AI </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> AI will continue to become increasingly important in business. Artificial intelligence makes data management and analysis more efficient. It can also perform challenging tasks that humans have a hard time doing. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Optimise for Voice Searches </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Thanks to Siri, Cortana and Alexa, brands are paying more attention to voice commerce optimisation. In the USA alone, voice-based commerce sales are skyrocketing and is projected to reach $40 billion by 2022. So, you should start optimising your content for this. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Voice searching is an amazing technological development. Not only does it lessen screen time, but it also makes it easier to find relevant information without the hassle of pulling out a smartphone or device. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Vertical Videos </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The importance of video content and its incredible return on investment is well documented. However, you cannot simply upload any video; you need a strategy. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Each day, people watch countless videos on YouTube, Instagram Twitter, Facebook, and other popular platforms. However, people do not like turning their smartphones to the side just to watch videos. In response, you need to publish vertical videos. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Aside from publishing videos on your social media platforms, you should also not forget the importance of live videos. This form of digital marketing, when combined with other strategies such as influencer marketing, will encourage customers to interact more with your brand because of its spontaneity and personality. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Personalised Email </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> People mainly use their email for academic, legal, commercial, and personal purposes. This is why it remains as one of the best channels for communication. To succeed in email marketing, you have to combine automation and personalisation. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Don't Be Afraid of Change </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style=";margin:0px;"> Marketing has come a long way from what it once was a decade ago. Recent trends should not be ignored since they signal what consumers want. Developing brand awareness and interacting with your audience are important in business today. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> <b> With the tips listed above, you can improve your performance and stay ahead of the game. </b> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<description>If you’re looking for help with your social media management, get in touch with us today to see how we can help!</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;text-align:center; display:block;"> <a style="margin:0px;"> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/social_media-icon.jpg" alt="" title="" style="margin-left:auto;display:block;width:fit-content;float:none;margin-right:auto;"/> </a> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;text-align:left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> </p> <p> Social media: an entirely different world from the one we physically live in, where people can freely express themselves and be who they are without any laws trying to hamper their efforts. When you look at it from an interactive standpoint, you’ll find that social media is quite interesting in terms of how people represent themselves, specifically in regards to how they act, what they say, and what they’re interested in. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> With billions of people on social media, the idea of the digital platform becoming a new planet or continent in its entirety is an idea that isn’t too far fetched. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Compared to the earlier expectations of social media population numbers, amassing billions of users online is far from what was expected of different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram — an unexpected development that has caught the attention of millions of brands, companies, and service providers. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> The advantage of taking your business to social media </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Although most objected at first, businesses use social media to maximize their profit potential and their audience impact to improve business growth, which in turn has made taking a business online non-negotiable when trying to thrive and survive in the digital age. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> With a large number of consumers with cash at the ready just surfing around online for the majority of the day, businesses need to take the extra steps to ensure that their voice can reach potential customers on the web. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Rather than go for the standard “buy now” approach and other traditional business tactics, businesses and corporations have given their image a boost by carrying out their brand identity through social media in a way that makes their image look like a person that consumers can relate to. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> By using captivating brand identities, using the right tonalities, and opening themselves up for consumer interaction, businesses that have social media-driven marketing strategies are enjoying and will continue to enjoy a boost that will allow them to reach their goals much faster. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> What you need to know about running your business online </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> While the concept of freedom runs rampant in terms of how people use social media, it doesn’t go the same way for businesses. Compared to an individual social media user, businesses on social media are held to a higher standard and are more vulnerable to relentless scrutiny if they make a mistake. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Getting things done the wrong way on social media can result in negative publicity that can harm your business’ sales, its image, and its standing compared to the other competitors. Business’ online are working even harder to ensure that they don’t cross any lines on social media because taking one step too far can make the difference between a business doing well or being prepared to fail. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> When trying to run a business on social media, it’s also important to note that your own profile and that of your employees and other people in the organization can also severely affect the way things will go in the future. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Having an employee post something bigoted or allowing a high-level executive to post something sensitive (see: Elon Musk) can cause sales to drop and stock prices to go down. For this reason, it’s incredibly important to have everything under control on social media when running a business. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 4 tips you’ll have to follow when managing your business on social media </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> In order to avoid having your business end up on the wrong side of things on social media, here are a few things you need to do and watch out for when trying to establish a strong brand online: </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 1. Strike a balance in your online presence </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Here’s the thing about thriving as a business on social media: if you don’t use social media, clients and customers will think that you’re no longer operational. Many of them will forget you and move on to other providers of the same products and services. If you’re using it too much, on the other hand, your audience will think that you’ve thrown professionalism out the window entirely. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> When trying to run your business on social media, it’s important to note that you should have a complete and accurate profile. Make sure that you limit your posting to around 1-2 times a day (unless you’re an information source or a news outlet) and stay responsive in your page’s inbox as well. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 2. Don’t get involved in the wrong conversations </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> No client or customer would want to get anything from a business that engages in conversations that they shouldn’t be involved in. This is a fact, and definitely a non-negotiable when doing business on social media. Discussing personal issues (such as politics, sex, drugs and alcohol, anything bigoted, or anything violent) can point your prospective customers towards the other direction and strip you of any opportunities for deals to be made. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 3. Avoid sharing the wrong content </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Memes: they can crack up a laugh every time they pop up on your feed, are definitely share-worthy, and remind you of fond memories — but do they really even belong on your business page to begin with? Sharing content that isn’t in your niche and putting out nonsensical posts can harm your social media standing as a business, so it’s best to steer clear of anything that isn’t related to your products or services. Stick to what helps your business present itself as credible in the eyes of consumers. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 4. Create valuable content </b> </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> This is one of the most underutilized, yet effective tips that you can follow when trying to run your business on social media, especially because quality content can help you stand out in the best way possible. When forming your business’s identity online, you’ll want to consider creating a social media plan for what you’re going to post, when you’ll have to post it, and how much you’ll have to share it. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Truth be told, posting valuable content on social media will help with your goals online. It can definitely amp up the sales rates that you’ll be making through your sales funnel. If you’re unsure of how you could go about with this step, it’s best to contact a digital marketing agency to take care of how you’ll be putting valuable content out on social media. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> If you’re looking for help with your social media management, get in touch with us today to see how we can help! </p> <b> <br/> <br/> </b> <p> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>Our Three-Step Guide to Building The Perfect Fashion Website</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/our-three-step-guide-to-building-the-perfect-fashion-website</link>
<description>If you’re looking to build a website for your small business, get in touch with us today for a free consultation!</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;text-align:center; display:block;"> <a style="margin:0px;"> <img src="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/3bf9413c/dms3rep/multi/pretty.jpg" alt="" title="" style="margin-left:auto;display:block;width:fit-content;float:none;margin-right:auto;"/> </a> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;text-align:left;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> </p> <p> Those who work in fashion can often tell you everything there is to know about trends, fabrics, and even well-known people in the industry. If you ask the very same people about website design, however, your question will most likely be met with an awkward pause. Regardless of how in-demand a fashion brand’s clothing items are, it’s easy to miss out on sales because of a number of other mistakes. Smaller brands have to worry about fast-fashion retailers that steal designs, established designers that are hard to go against, and even weak brand authority. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Wait—let’s take a moment to focus on that final point (that you probably have a few questions about): weak brand authority. Today, the online world is the domain on which brands make a name for themselves. Some fashion entrepreneurs are still under the impression that an online presence isn’t that important for running a successful fashion brand, but the truth is that it’s a difference-maker that can boost your sales and drive brand recognition. There are hundreds of thousands of fashion businesses that have their own way of catering to a customer’s desire to look stylish—a truth that justifies the fact that you’ll need to play to your strengths. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> With social media, you can expect to see your fashion business rise above your competitors, especially when your designs stand out in the eyes of your customers. There is a whole array of different platforms that you can work with, but the best platform you can go with as a fashion business is a website. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> Effective website building tips </b> </p> <p> How can you create a website that helps your fashion business thrive? Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you put a one-stop web portal together for your customers to enjoy: </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 1. Choose the right web developer to work with </b> </p> <p> Just like a great selection of clothing products for your business, having an attractive, functional, and high-quality website can impact the way the word about your brand goes around. The greatest way to ensure that your website looks, feels, and performs well is to hire the right web developer for the job. Seek one who has experience building websites for fashion brands. A great way to source out web development talent for your fashion business is to consult with different established web design firms. They are most likely to have copious amounts of experience in the industry and a list of extremely satisfied clientele. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 2. Narrow down your options with the help of portfolios </b> </p> <p> One thing that both the fashion and web development industries have in common is the presence of portfolios. If fashion businesses and designers have lookbooks, then web designers have portfolios that can convince clients and businesses about the quality of work that they can expect. With lots of options to choose from in terms of web developer on the market, one of the easiest ways to streamline the process is to look at the portfolio of different service providers. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> <b> 3. Go for fashion blog-style website content </b> </p> <p> Aside from planning for the website’s inner workings, appearance, back-end, and front-end, one important part to watch out for is the content that ties your website together. There are different ways fashion businesses can make the most out of their websites, but no format works better to attract customers than fashion blogs. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> Fashion blogs are a type of content that well-known fashion brands around use to engage with and provide value to customers. Most consumers are out and about on the internet looking for new information. When inserting a blog portion into your website, you may want to look into hiring the services of a professional blog writer or ghostwriter. </p> <b> <br/> </b> <p> If you’re looking to build a website for your small business, get in touch with us today for a free consultation! </p> <br/> <p> </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>How Much Time is Spent on Social Media?</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/how-much-time-is-spent-on-social-media</link>
<description>Do you often find yourself browsing your fave social media sites when you know you could be doing other things? You’re not alone.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> According to recent studies, the average person spends 18% of their time online browsing social media sites. The most popular social media sites are the obvious platforms – Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> What this means for your business is that you can leverage the time spent on social media sites to increase engagement with your target audience. Post an interesting and informative link related to your niche even if this is something that is independent of your website. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Create an amazing blog entry for your website that makes it easy for people to share on their walls will help spread the word about your business and what it does. Whenever somebody shares your posts, you’re receiving free brand advertising! </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Sharing things on Facebook and Twitter is the obvious way to tell people about information important to your niche, or your industry. YouTube videos doing the same will fare ever better. Videos are incredibly effective for creating that engaging content that can mean the difference between a high bounce rate and getting visitors who stick around for a while because they like what they see. YouTube is considered “social media” because it’s very easy to create brand-new videos and share or embed them on Facebook, Twitter and your own blog. By utilising video in your social media campaigns, potential customers see who you are and they can really see how your products and services work and get a feel for your business as a whole. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The fact is, your buying audience spends an enormous amount of time online, and a good percentage of that time is spent researching products and services, looking at reviews, and essentially seeking referrals from those they know and trust. Increasing your businesses social media presence will find your at the center of where your online audience “hangs out”, and is a natural fit for just about any businesses marketing plan. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> By keeping your posts, images and videos relevant, entertaining, and informative, you’ll gain the greatest reach with your content. Utilizing social media platforms to the betterment of your bottom line is not difficult, but it does take consistency and a bit of knowledge regarding the different available platforms. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<title>THE BEGINNERS GUIDE TO SEO</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/the-beginners-guide-to-seo-search-engine-optimisation</link>
<description>With an experienced team that provides fast, reliable, effective results — we help you grow your business on Google for the long term.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The internet features hundreds of millions of domains with billions of web pages and even more content being added daily. How do you get your website noticed among all of that information? </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This practice is known as Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). The main purpose of SEO is to build a website, which will be easily read by search engine algorithms. Always remember: the goal of a search engine is to display the most relevant information to their visitor's inquiry. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Understanding Web Traffic </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Web Traffic is simply the data exchange between a website and the user. Using SEO practices is about generating more relevant web traffic for a website. The keyword in that statement is "relevant". There are some business owners, marketers, and webmasters who think that having a higher amount of web traffic is automatically better. It's not. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Website A may have 5,000 visitors, while Website B has 10,000. However, website analytics tell that Website A has 2,500 of 5,000 visitors actually exploring the website while Website B only has 1,000 of 10,000. Website A will generate more potential leads thanks to effective SEO. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Generating Web Traffic </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> There are many ways to generate web traffic, but they typically fall into a few particular approaches. Paid traffic generation includes, but is not limited to, Pay-Per-Click advertising, banner advertising, and email campaigns. Natural traffic is generated from a website by its own presence. An established website may have built great rankings over time, thus showing search engines it has the information their users are looking for. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A word used in conjunction with these styles is "organic." The search engines accept a moderate amount of contribution from external sources to help search engine rankings. They do frown upon and take action against websites that attempt to create unfair conditions. Legitimate paid services are methodical, so they appear organic. Avoid doing business with any SEO professional or using any tactic that claims extraordinary, immediate results. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Understanding Search Engine Algorithms </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> The search engine algorithm is the coding that the engine uses to determine the type, quality, and relevance of a website's content. The algorithm is responsible for tallying results and assigning the website a Search Engine Result Position, also known as a SERP. (SERP is also an acronym for Search Engine Result Page depending on the context.) </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Search engine bot (also knows as "crawler") arrives at this conclusion by reading website meta-data to interpret relevance, counting the number and quality of links to the content, checking for any potentially abusive behaviour, and a number of other practices. They are very complicated entities that do change with regularity as search engines adopt new policies and crackdown on negative practices. The aforementioned are specifically mentioned as they are parts of the process that a website can actively pursue for SEO benefit. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Not all search engine algorithms are the same. However, most entities cater more to Google than any other search engine. Google handles approximately 90% of all web searches. Google uses a term called PageRank on a scale of 0 (ignored) to 10 (most relevant) for positioning purposes. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Influencing A Website's SERP </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Actually influencing a website SERP relies on a steady, consistent approach. Remember, the goal of a search engine is to provide information most relevant to the user's inquiry. A demonstration of relevance generally starts with the actual layout of the website. It needs to be easy to navigate and fairly intuitive so visitors can find what they are looking for. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A number of search engines count the quantity and quality of links to content to help rank it. The idea is simply that people are not going to link to junk content. No one likes having their time wasted. The higher the SERP (or PageRank) of the website providing the link, the more weight it carries on the calculation. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> A website that wants to compete needs to have quality, relevant text. A number of marketers will build a website with relevant information that does not necessarily focus on sales. Instead, they offer quality articles to demonstrate their expertise. Additionally, that type of content is what others want to link to. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Example: A computer repair and building business wants to build an SEO friendly website. A bad approach would be for the business to just post up a bunch of their product and sales pages. Why? That content is only relevant to people looking to specifically purchase that content. However, if the same business posted articles about choosing the right components, how to assemble a computer yourself, and more informative articles; their website becomes more relevant to a bigger group of people. They can still have their products and services posted, but now they will have much more relevant traffic from people wanting to build their own computer, which is their potential customer base. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Applying SEO To A Business Website </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> SEO is an integral part of any business website strategy. Actually applying these principles to a website comes down to the choice between doing it yourself and hiring an SEO expert. A medium to large business is going to want to outsource the work to an expert. A small business needs to evaluate their current situation and what they can afford. A person can do their own SEO work with reasonable results. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Why Hire An SEO Expert? </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Search engines are not static entities. They constantly change and tweak their algorithms to make improvements. An effective SEO campaign takes time and attention over an extended period. There are better ways for businesses to spend that time- such as servicing customers, selling products, or developing new products. An SEO expert makes understanding this field their core competency. The expert will invest their time and money into staying current with changes. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Is SEO A Do-It-Yourself Project? </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> SEO companies are a business like any other. They demonstrate their expertise in the field by providing high-quality information on their websites and professional blogs. All of the information a person needs to undertake an SEO campaign for their business is freely available. The deciding factor will be if the person will have the time to dedicate to understanding and applying these principles.

<title>Why Most Businesses Fail To Capture the Millennial Market</title>
<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/why-most-businesses-fail-to-capture-the-millennial-market</link>
<description>Thoughtfully curated videos will go a long way in steering those mysterious and elusive millennials your way.</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Millennials are a misunderstood generation, and many organisations fail to adapt to changing trends. It’s a classical case of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, it doesn’t work. If you don’t adhere to your customer wants, needs, and traits, you won’t sell. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> But in the organization’s defense, millennials are a very diverse generation with varying needs and wants. Many businesses try to circumvent intensive research by oversimplifying millennials as these trendy, hip urbanites with lots of cash to burn on things they don’t need. It won’t take long for your marketing efforts to fail if its foundation is rooted in convoluted concepts of customer engagement. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Sprucing up Your Brand Image </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> If there’s one thing that millennials hate more than being stereotyped into working the gig economy, then it would be the superficial attempts to lure them into buying more stuff from you with crude ads. Millennials have grown up being bombarded by an endless stream of ads and can navigate through them with the efficiency of a machine! It’s no point trying to retrofit your brand around what <em> you </em> think the millennials want. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Instead, go deep into market analytics and utilize tools like machine learning and artificial intelligence to learn who your audience is, what they want, and what the core principles behind your brand represent. It’s what Netflix did, and it’s what Google and other big tech giants are currently doing with their marketing strategy. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Not Using Videos Enough </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Millennials don’t like reading ads. Period. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> It’s the one thing they have learnt to avoid since the early 2000s. They treat them like they would treat an unwelcomed elephant in the room – with profound ignorance. But that’s where videos have come to upend this trend and make your life as a marketer a little easier. Videos, especially live streaming, have become the primary tool which drive your brand’s marketing efforts. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Millennials consume videos, even those spattered with wanton advertisements that inspire them to do a myriad of things you would expect from a typical customer. These include visiting your website for subscription, buying your merchandise, and even becoming part of your organization – all because of a video you streamed online. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Content is King </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Content marketing is the juice that keeps your marketing efforts afloat. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This might seem like an oxymoron because earlier we frowned upon text-only ad spaces, but when applied within the context of original, meaningful, valuable content, words can have a powerful impact on the millennial market. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> They are, after all, enormous consumers of content, and if we were to go by industry trends, content marketing coupled with thoughtfully curated videos will go a long way in steering those  mysterious and elusive millennials your way. </p> </div></content:encoded>

<link>http://www.yourdigitalagency.com.au/6-must-have-plugins-for-wordpress-marketers</link>
<description>Which are the must-have plugins for WordPress? Which ones are worth investing time, money, and effort in?</description>
<content:encoded><div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> WordPress can be a powerful tool for marketers, thanks to its customisability. Here are the must have plugins for WordPress marketers. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> WordPress is one of the most customisable CMS tools out there, giving marketers all the space they need to reach out to potential consumers. That's why over 30% of today's websites <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/05/wordpress-now-powers-30-of-websites/"> run on WordPress </a> . </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> However, having a pretty website isn't enough. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Empower your WordPress site with the right plugins. Plugins give your site capabilities to further analyse data, schedule posts, automate responses, and more. The only problem is there's an ocean of them. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Which are the must-have plugins for WordPress? Which ones are worth investing time, money, and effort in? </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Don't fret, we've got you covered. Here's our list of 6 WordPress marketing plugins you simply can't do without: </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> SEO Press </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Search Engine Optimisation should be your top priority. Without good SEO, your site is virtually invisible to both Google and people surfing the Web. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> SEO Press serves to fix this. This plugin is so important that <a href="http://www.yourwordpressagency.com.au/"> every professional </a> will start here. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> It provides analytical tools to check every blog post, create XML sitemaps, analyse on-page SEO, and snippet previews. It also allows you to check how your site performs on other search engines instead of limiting performance to only Google. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> WooCommerce </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Let's get one thing straight: WooCommerce is likely the only e-commerce plugin you'll need. It gives you all the tools needed to run a commercial site, such as a manageable shopping cart, different payment options, and the ability to send notifications to customers who abandoned their carts. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> If you're looking for an alternative, Shopify is quickly rising up the ranks as a competing plugin. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> W3 Total  Cache </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Optimising your site for a better User Experience (UX) should be your second priority, right after boosting SEO. If your <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/"> site is too slow </a> or difficult to navigate, people will leave. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> This is where W3 Total Cache comes in. It helps reduce load times, resolve issues with the server, and better CDN integration. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> OptinMonster </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> As a marketer, you'll need an avenue to keep in touch with leads. OptinMonster is the best solution for the matter. It not only provides beautiful forms to add to your site but allows you to split test them for better evaluation. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> AddThis </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> Social media might not directly boost SEO but there's no denying the marketability of their platforms. Sharing posts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Instagram can work in your favour for better branding and increasing word-of-mouth marketing. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> AddThis gives you the power to take control of this. The plugin lets you add multiple social media share buttons where you want and when you want. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Google XML Sitemaps </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> We can't talk about must have plugins for WordPress without mentioning Google XML Sitemaps. Sitemaps help search engines like Google crawl the content of your site and identify every element. The best thing about this plugin is that it does most of the work by itself — simply install and watch it do the work for you. </p> </div> <h2 style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px; margin-block-start:1em; margin-block-end:1em;"> Get These Must Have Plugins for WordPress Today! </h2> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> These are only 6 must have plugins for WordPress; there are many more you can take advantage of today. You can try out a WordPress calendar plugin or a Pinterest integration plugin, for example. </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> That said, these 6 alone can already boost your site's marketability. Don't sleep on these plugins and get them today! </p> </div> <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:35px;" data-rss-type="text"> <p style="margin:0px;"> But don't stop here.
